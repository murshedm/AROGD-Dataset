CHAPTER 4: SYSTEMATIC EVALUATION OF EXISTING CYBER GUIDANCE AND 
FRAMEWORKS 
 
 
 
 
 Similar to the development of resilience definitions in the previous chapter, evaluating 
cyber guidance requires a multi-source and multi-faceted approach. Understanding the co-
occurrence of resilience terms with cyber terms is critical to determining whether the existing 
cyber guidance and frameworks have sufficient scope on the time and scale aspects of resilience. 
This chapter includes three major processes: 1) development of a cyber and resilience dictionary, 
2) classification of dictionary terms by time and scale, and 3) evaluation of existing cyber 
guidance and frameworks against the dictionary and previous results from the resilience analysis 
in the last chapter.  
The development of the broader cyber dictionary proceeds as follows. First, the 
definitions will be cleaned, tokenized, and lemmatized for follow on analysis. Second, based on 
the volume of definitions present in some of the sources, the corpus will be evaluated for down 
selection using BERT algorithms to determine the most relevant or popular terms. Third, the 
curated dictionary will be evaluated for existing resilience terms, and, if lacking, the terminology 
will be added to provide for follow on co-occurrence analysis.  
 
Second, the terms in the cyber dictionary are classified by time and scale based on the 
concepts developed in the previous chapter to develop a two-dimensional scaffold on which the 
existing cyber guidance, standards, and frameworks can be evaluated. The objective of this 
scaffold is to show how the distribution of cyber and resilience terms is distributed across time 
and scale alongside the co-occurrence between cyber and resilience terms.  

66 
 
Lastly, a broad search for existing cyber and resilience standards, guidance, and 
frameworks is curated for analysis. The data set primarily includes guidance for cybersecurity 
processes and practices but will also be expanded to include resilience guidance for other areas, 
such as climate change, critical infrastructure, and national resilience to help baseline the results 
from the analysis in this chapter. These existing cyber guidance, standards, and frameworks will 
be assessed using both the scaffold and the prior data-centric analyses of resilience definitions. 
This process will elicit the time and scale aspects of resilience in the existing guidance and 
provides a parallel analysis of co-occurrence and cosine similarities for resilience-oriented terms 
and topics from the tf*idf and LDA analyses in the previous chapter.  
 
Curating a Dictionary of Cyber Definition using Large Language Models 
 
Several government and industry sources provide extensive and curated lists of cyber 
definitions. 4,465 terms were scraped or downloaded from the National Institute of Standards 
and Technology Computer Security Resource Center, the Canadian Center for Cyber Security, 
the National Initiative for Cybersecurity Careers and Studies program at the Cybersecurity & 
Infrastructure Security Agency, the Committee on National Security Systems, and the SANS 
Institute [29], [30], [118], [119], [120]. The definition set contains 9,203 definitions for the 4,465 
terms, indicating duplicate coverage for most terms, at a minimum. The statistical descriptors for 
the number of definitions per term are shown in Table 5:

The term “resilience” set the maximum number of definitions at 121, as described in the previous 
chapter, since those definitions were added to the list of terms. Without that term, the top ten 
terms with the most definitions are: assessment, cryptographic key, information system, user, 
authenticate, cyber threat, key, access control, digital signature, and approved (relating to 
approved cryptographic algorithms), which had between 24-43 definitions each.  
 
Assessing Definitions using BERT Algorithms 
 
Working with 4,465 terms in assessing the existing cyber guidance would be 
cumbersome, and many of the definitions have narrow applications in cyber fields, such as three-
key triple data encryption algorithm (3TDEA), derived relationship mapping, prime number, or 
s-box. To make data management and analysis easier with minimal loss of fidelity, the next phase 
evaluates the dictionary terms using BERT algorithms for popularity or relevance. The use of 
BERT algorithms allows the corpora of training data and weights in those algorithms to be used 
to determine relevance or popularity of the term within the broader corpus, whether a general 

68 
training data set or a specified and tuned data set. For this analysis, a dual evaluation will be 
performed using the DistilBERT Base Uncased algorithm, fine-tuned on the Stanford Sentiment 
Treebank (SST-2) dataset, and the SecureBERT Plus algorithm, a RoBERTa algorithm fine-tuned 
on 253,433 cybersecurity documents [121], [122]. Both algorithms were sourced from Hugging 
Face and implemented using the following python packages: json (v3.13), matplotlib 
(v3.8), Seaborn (v0.12.2), transformers (v4.42.3), pandas (v2.1.4), NumPy 
(v1.24.3), and Scikit-Learn (v1.4.2) [123-131]. DistilBERT provides a faster and more 
computationally efficient BERT algorithm that has been trained on a broad or general dataset. It 
provides an appropriate counterweight to a tuned cybersecurity algorithm like SecureBERT Plus 
to prevent biasing the results excessively toward the existing cyber literature. A weighted average 
output of the two algorithms will create the final dictionary of terms.  
 
The two models provided different results, as expected, based on their training corpora 
and colloquial usage in those corpora. The DistilBERT algorithm produced the following results, 
visualized in a word cloud and as a histogram by term relevance, for the most relevant terms 
from the dictionary in common usage, shown in Figure 14 and Figure 15, below.  

69 
 
Figure 14: Word cloud of top 500 terms from DistilBERT ranking of cyber terms. 
 
Figure 15: Histogram of cyber term relevance using the DistilBERT algorithm. 

70 
A qualitative review of the top 500 terms explains the left skew of the histogram: most of the 
terms are not niche cyber terms, but terms that have multiple meanings within the broader 
English language.  
 
The SecureBERT Plus algorithm, on the other hand, produces a histogram that is closer to 
normally distributed rather than the extreme skew of the DistilBERT results. This is an artifact of 
the cyber-centric training corpora of the model. Since taking the top 500 results by relevance 
score will only select the right-hand tail of the distribution, the terms within ±0.25 standard 
deviations of the mean score will be selected. This selection was manually verified by checking 
for common words, such as information, firewall, access control, etc. Those common terms were 
not in the selection from the right hand tail but were present in the mean selection. This approach 
yielded 939 terms, which are highlighted in the histogram showing in Figure 16 below.  
 
Figure 16: Histogram of cyber term relevance using the SecureBERT Plus algorithm 

71 
The terms in this set are visualized with a word cloud, shown below in Figure 17. 
 
Figure 17: Word cloud of terms within +/- 0.25 standard deviations of the mean score from the SecureBERT Plus algorithm 
 
 
The terms selected from the outputs of these two models do have some overlap, as shown 
in the Venn diagram in Figure 18. The diagram is based on the outputs of both models, not the 
weighted average that will be performed to develop the final dictionary.  

72 
 
Figure 18: Venn diagram showing overlap of the two sets of top terms from the DistilBERT and SecureBERT Plus models. 
 
The combined term set that will form the dictionary is combined by weighing the scores 
for a term from the DistilBERT model and the SecureBERT Plus model in a 25/75 split. 
Selection of the weighting ratio was arbitrary. This produced the following weighted term set of 
1339 terms, approximately 30 percent of the original dictionary, visualized in a word cloud in 
Figure 19. The final dictionary of terms is provided in Appendix 1.  

73

Understanding Existing Overlap Between Cyber and Resilience Terms 
 
Hypotheses 3 and 4 seek to understand how well the existing cybersecurity documents 
incorporate aspects of resilience (H3) and rise above the technical and sociotechnical aspects 
(H4) of cybersecurity. Using the prior tf*idf and Latent Dirichlet Allocation analysis results, 
along with the lemmatized set of resilience definitions, the final dictionary can be analyzed for 
that overlap. This analysis of the dictionary against the resilience terms will provide a first look 
into how the answers to those hypotheses are trending.  
 
The use of the prior analyses and lemmatized set of resilience definitions will provide a 
multi-faceted look at the dictionary. The lemmatized set of definitions provides a straightforward 
comparison and overlap, regardless of term importance or frequency. It answers the broader 

74 
question of whether the dictionary has any relationship to the resilience definitions, regardless of 
how the terms are used. The tf*idf and LDA analyses provide a focused overlap examination to 
determine how much overlap there is between the dictionary terms and the most important terms 
and topics from the resilience definitions.  
 
Overall, the results of this analysis can be visualized as a four-set Venn diagram, 
indicating the amount of overlap between the sets. Figure 20, below, shows the results of this 
analysis.  
  
Figure 20: A Venn diagram showing the overlap of terms between the combined cyber terms dictionary, the set of lemmatized 
resilience definitions, the tf*idf analysis results, and the Latent Dirichlet Allocation analysis results. 

75 
As is readily apparent, there is little overlap between the resilience analyses and the combined set 
of cyber terms. The coverage ratio, a simple division of the total number of terms overlapping 
the dictionary divided by the dictionary, is found to be 2.46%. The following words overlapped 
with the dictionary:  
 Tf*idf analysis (4): State, recovery, resource, and attack. 
 LDA analysis (1): State. 
 Lemmatized Resilience Definitions (33): Exposure, disruption, response, hazard, breach, 
target, learning, operation, knowledge, skill, state, group, goal, attribute, author, failure, 
attack, damage, degradation, capability, stage, vulnerability, problem, activity, asset, 
resource, stability, recovery, incident, relationship, survivability, compromise, and 
critical.  
Given the research in Chapter 3 on the challenges of finding a resilience definition, it is possible 
that the resilience terms simply are not popular or relevant enough to have made it into the 
dictionary but may still be present in the broader corpus of 4,465 terms that were culled. The 
same analyses can be performed on that broader set to account for this possibility. The results are 
shown in Figure 21, below.  

76 
 
Figure 21: A Venn diagram showing the overlap of terms between the total corpus of cyber terms, the set of lemmatized resilience 
definitions, the tf*idf analysis results, and the Latent Dirichlet Allocation analysis results. 
The coverage ratio for this broader set is lower, at 1.43%. The reduction in coverage ratio 
indicates that the overlapped terms are sufficiently relevant in the cyber term corpus to have 
passed selection into the final dictionary, and that there are not proportionally more terms present 
in the broader corpus that are unaccounted for. The overlapped terms are:  
 Tf*idf analysis (15): State, recovery, resource, attack, environment, event, process, 
disturbance, cyber, function, risk, outcome, identity, individual, and adversity.  
 LDA analysis (8): State, variable, function, disturbance, process, event, mitigate, and 
environment. 

77 
 Lemmatized Resilience Definitions (64): Exposure, environment, mitigate, challenge, 
disruption, response, event, hazard, device, risk, breach, identity, cybersecurity, target, 
bend, learning, operation, knowledge, process, skill, disturbance, cyber, parameter, 
network, core, outcome, state, group, goal, individual, attribute, failure, author, actor, 
specific, safety, attack, context, domain, aid, damage, adversity, degradation, threat, 
comparison, capability, stage, vulnerability, baseline, problem, identify, activity, asset, 
resource, stability, recovery, function, variable, incident, relationship, service, 
survivability, compromise, and critical.   
As this analysis shows, both the curated dictionary and the broader corpus of cyber-
related terms have minimal exposure to the resilience terms identified in the previous chapter. A 
portion of the resilience terms do appear in both the broader corpus and the final dictionary, but 
the lack of broader context for the terms in the dictionary prevents a more thorough analysis of 
co-occurrence and semantic relationships between the terms—are the resilience terms being used 
in ways that connote resilience as the interdisciplinary community has loosely defined it? That 
level of analysis will be saved for answering the central research question when the semantic 
richness in whole documents can be used.  
 
The Analytical Scaffold and Term Classification by Time and Scale 
 
To assess how existing guidance supports the development of cyber resilience, the 
concepts presented in this chapter can be used to create a conceptual scaffolding or framework 
from which to analyze existing guidance. At the meta level, resilience has components across 
both time and scale, as previously described in Chapter 4. These can be used to develop a two-

78 
dimensional scale similar to Figure 11 in Chapter 3. The use of a two-dimensional scale will 
allow for both qualitative and quantitative analysis of the existing cyber guidance. Additionally, 
the use of a two-dimensional scale also provides the start of a useful mental model for 
practitioners to think through qualitatively, and potentially quantitatively, how to assess the level 
of resilience in an organization or develop a strategy to improve cyber resilience.  
 
The two-dimensional scaffold assesses each term for its localized point of action with 
respect to time and scale. For example, a firewall operates at machine speed (time) and is a part 
of the technical system (scale), whereas a cyber risk management and governance process in an 
organization operates at human speeds (time), measured in days to weeks, and primarily at the 
organizational level (scale). The qualitative classifiers will be assigned numerical values solely 
for the purpose of quantitative analysis later, such as centroid calculations based on scatterplots 
of the terms and similar approaches. To account for the log-log relationship identified in Chapter 
4, and to provide further separation for quantitative analysis, the numerical values assigned to 
each category of time and scale will be taken from the Fibonacci sequence rather than sequential 
integers. Table 6, below, shows the classifier assignments. Further details on what each classified 
generally covers will follow.

For the time classifiers, the terms connote the following: 
 Immediate: Seconds to minutes, machine speed, instantaneous, automated. May apply to 
terms like automated logging, real-time alerts, intrusion detection systems, firewalls, etc.  
 Short: Hours to days, benchmarked off human capacity for response and adaptation. May 
apply to things like incident response, software patching, DevOps, security information 
and event management (SIEM) systems, etc. 
 Mid: Weeks to months, the time it takes organizations to implement longer term changes. 
May apply to enterprise architecture updates, risk management, supply chain 
management, policy changes, threat hunting, etc.  
 Long: Years. These are system shifts or adaptations that evolve over an extended period, 
such as implementation of new national or international regulations or standards. May 
apply to public laws, governance and risk compliance activities, executive orders, long-
term strategy, etc.   
 Generational: Multiple decades to centuries. Not likely to be seen for cyber resilience 
applications, but would apply to things like climate change, geopolitical shifts, evolution 
of technology and norms, ecological changes, etc.  
For the scale classifiers, the terms generally apply as follows:  
 Technical: The focus is on individual technical components or a technical system that do 
not require significant human interaction. May apply to terms like firewall, cryptographic 
keys, wide area network, hard drive, etc.  
 Sociotechnical: The combination of technical systems that require human interaction to 
function properly. May apply to terms like identity and access management, access 

80 
controls, incident response, security information and event management systems, DevOps 
pipelines, software development, threat hunting, vulnerability management, etc.  
 Organizational: The human side of the sociotechnical system, where primarily human-
driven activities take place. This includes terms like risk management, supply chain 
management, governance, policy development, organizational strategy, organizational 
culture, etc.  
 Community/Sector: How the organization fits into a broader ecosystem. The ecosystem 
has a generally identifiable set of norms, practices, and governance structure. This 
includes terms like sector-specific policies, critical infrastructure, ecosystems, industry 
standard development, interoperability, information sharing and analysis centers, etc.  
 National/International: Focuses primarily on actions that operate on a national or 
international scale. May apply to terms like national resilience, executive orders, United 
Nations or other international body actions, such as the Convention on Climate Change 
(COP29) framework on reduction targets, etc. Language here is expected to be far less 
technical and more broadly applicable than for any other scale.   
To assist in classification across both dimensions for each for the 1,339 terms, the above 
information was fed into the Claude 3.5 Sonnet algorithm to generate example classifiers for 
each scale to support follow on few-shot classification [132].7 The example classifiers are used in 
with a Jaccard similarity calculation to determine overlap with terms to classify the terms by 
time, scale, and numerical assignments, and export the results to a file for review. The output of 
the classification script was manually reviewed to check for reasonableness of classifier 
 
7 Several algorithms were tried, including ChatGPT and DistilBERT (via a python script), but Claude 3.5 Sonnet 
proved more capable for this application of zero-shot application than the other algorithms.  

81 
assignment and its corresponding numerical assignment, and the classification was performed 
iteratively to adjust example language. Several small, final adjustments were made manually to 
arrive at a final classification and numerical assignment. The final dictionary, with classifiers but 
without numerical assignments, is provided in Appendix 1 for further review.  
 
Curating Cyber and Resilience Guidance and Standards for Evaluation 
 
The central research question (RQ1) seeks to determine whether a single strategy, 
standard, or other guidance document exists to provide organizations at multiple levels of society 
with support for improving cyber resilience. An expansive search was conducted to gather as 
many different cyber standards and other guidance documents as possible. 37 documents were 
gathered, including those from U.S and other international government agencies, standards 
organizations, and other sources, and from highly technical publications such as firmware 
resiliency to holistic or sector-specific standards, such as critical infrastructure or cyber supply 
chain risk management and cyber-resilient systems development:

To check the scaffolding for adequacy and provide juxtaposition for the cyber frameworks, 
standards, and other guidance, an additional twelve sources were gathered from other disciplines 
such as climate change and disaster response, national resilience, community resilience, and 
social-ecological resilience, for a total of 49 documents. The search used iterative prompting 
with GPT-4 to identify standards or other resilience strategy documents that would not be 
forthcoming as easily through a traditional internet search [11]. This human-machine teaming 
demonstrated that more than half of the documents below have similar features to the other 
resilience documents and cybersecurity frameworks.

Systems Analysis [181] 
 
As described in Chapter 2, the documents were passed through a curation pipeline to 
clean the documents, remove stop words, and tokenize and lemmatize the text. Stop word 
removal and tokenization was accomplished with the NLTK (V3.8.1) package along with a 
custom stop word dictionary developed through an iterative approach during the resilience 
document pre-processing and further customized based on additional iterative analysis with this 
new document set [16], [22]. The tokenized definitions were lemmatized using the spaCy 

85 
(V3.7.5) package with a maximum character length set to 5,000,000 to account for the longest 
texts [18].  
 
A Data-Centric Understanding of the Corpus of 37 Cyber Documents 
 
The remainder of this chapter analyzes the documents using tf*idf, Latent Dirichlet 
Allocation, cosine similarity, and bigram analyses, on the full corpus, the 37 cyber texts, and the 
twelve non-cyber texts, to understand the language in the documents. Splitting the analyses 
between the two groups of text allows for greater understanding on how resilience terms appear 
in cyber and non-cyber, but resilience related, texts. Classification with the previously developed 
scaffolding and the analysis of those classification results will be performed in the next chapter.  
 
Hypothesis 4 postulated that the cyber guidance, frameworks, standards, and other 
strategies primarily involve the technical and related sociotechnical aspects of cyber security, not 
the broader aspects of resilience as understood by the broader interdisciplinary community. The 
analyses in this section indicate that the cyber documents in this study focus on risk management 
as the central factor in achieving cybersecurity objectives. The analyses used for the upcoming 
analyses use the following python packages: glob (V0.1.5), json (V3.13), pandas (V2.1.4), 
numpy (V1.24.3), matplotlib (V3.8), seaborn (V0.12.2), scikit-learn (V1.4.2), 
wordcloud (V1.9.3), and NLTK (V3.8.1) [16], [21], [22], [71], [72], [125], [126], [127], [130], 
[131], [182]. LDA analyses were confined to ten topics with a limit of twenty iterations to 
converge on the set of topics. As discussed in Chapter 3, ten topics is a reasonable starting point. 
Heuristic and qualitative analysis was iteratively conducted on the LDA results to ensure 
adequate topic separation content coverage. Ten topics proved sufficient to describe each of the 

86 
small texts and the corpus as a whole without much overlap. The results from each analysis will 
be briefly described, followed by a more thorough and integrative analysis of each body of texts.  
 
Time Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency Analysis 
 
Each of the documents was analyzed through the tf*idf processing pipeline, and the 
results at the document and corpus level were collected. At the level of an individual document, 
the statistical descriptors in Table 7 below indicate that most terms did not have meaningful 
significance within the body of the text. The mean score was close to zero, though the average 
(mean) maximum score for a document was 0.863. Many of these documents are short compared 
to broader machine learning data sets, so lower scores are expected since the terms simply cannot 
repeat often enough to emerge with a higher score as they would be able to in a larger data set. 
To understand the aggregate behavior across the 37 cyber texts, though, the scores for terms were 
summed and the top 25 results printed. The results of those analyses are shown in Table 8 and 
Figure 22 below.

Figure 22: Word cloud of the top 25 tf*idf terms from the corpus of 37 cyber texts. 
 
As the word cloud and top terms indicate, the largest themes across the body of 37 cyber 
texts are in risk and information management within an organization. While the efficacy of risk 
management procedures will not be explored in this research, the prior literature in this area calls 
its effectiveness into question [183]. Tellingly, the term resilien* does not appear in the top 25 
terms, despite several of the texts identifying resilience as a stated objective of the guidance.  
 

89 
Latent Dirichlet Allocation Analysis 
 
The Latent Dirichlet Allocation analysis results for the 37 cyber texts cover the major 
themes of the current best practices in organizational cyber security. The ten topics are provided 
in Table 9. As an unofficial or heuristic evaluation, the topics generally align with the Certified 
Information System Security Practitioner (CISSP) and the Security+ topical domains and body 
of knowledge, as should be expected with certifications demonstrating a solid fundamental 
understanding of the core concepts and best practices in organizational cybersecurity.

Cosine Similarity Analysis 
 
Cosine similarity is a measure of relatedness between two texts. The similarity values can 
fall between zero and one, with zero representing no overlap or similarity between the 
documents, and one representing a high degree of similarity. In the analysis of the 37 cyber texts, 
the majority of the cosine similarity scores, shown in the histogram in Figure 23 below fall 
between 0.1 and 0.4, indicating that the documents do not possess a high degree of similarity and 

91 
maintain their distinctiveness. The low similarity scores suggest that the corpus of 37 cyber texts 
will provide a broader perspective on cyber resilience than if the scores had a higher degree of 
similarity.   
 
Figure 23: Histogram of cosine similarities for 37 cyber texts. 
 
 
The pair index, Figure 24, shows the rank ordering of similarity scores, revealing the 
distribution shape and any outliers. While the histogram shows how many pairs have each 
similarity score, the pair index plot shows which pairs represent the highest and lowest 
similarities and how gradually or sharply the similarities change across all document pairs. This 
helps identify clusters of similarly-related documents and spot unusual document relationships 
that might be hidden in histogram bins. The "pair index" in the scatter plot represents the index 
of the document pairs when the similarity values are flattened into a single list. The positions of 

92 
the similarity values and shape of the pair index provide an alternative visual interpretation of the 
information in this histogram, particularly in highlighting how rapidly the paired similarity 
scores change across the corpus. In this case, as the histogram in Figure 23 indicates, most of the 
pairwise similarity scores indicate low similarity.

Frequency of Word Pairings: Bigram Analysis 
 
Finally, a bigram analysis of the texts indicates how often a particular word appears with 
another word and provides greater insight into how a particular word tends to be used in the 
texts. This analysis was performed on the 37 texts for the top bigrams containing the words 
“resilience,” “risk,” and “security,” since the latter two words were dominant in the tf*idf 
analysis from Table 8. For the bigrams containing “resilience,” the analysis is performed for both 

93 
the top bigrams containing “resilience” and the top bigrams in the documents with a higher tf*idf 
score for resilience.

Table 10 and Table 11 show a pronounced contrast in how the same set of texts treat 
resilience with request to the common cybersecurity terms “risk” and “security.” The frequency 
with which the documents discuss more traditional terms compared to resilience terms indicates, 
despite the titles or stated objectives, these documents are not likely to address resilience 
concepts at depth, or in a manner commensurate with the broader interdisciplinary community. 
As Table 10 shows, the majority of the cyber texts discuss resilience in some capacity, but from 
the documents that do discuss resilience, the top bigrams from those documents are traditional 
cybersecurity terminology.  
 
A Data-Centric Understanding of the Non-Cyber Document Corpus 
 
The same analysis was performed on the twelve non-cyber documents to get a 
comparative understanding against the 37 cyber documents. The tf*idf, Latent Dirichlet 
Allocation, and bigram analyses indicate, as expected, a stronger focus on the concepts of 
resilience. These documents were selected as a pseudo-control group since they were explicitly 
resilience focused and originated from non-cyber perspectives. Of note, the results from these 
analyses suggest that this corpus of texts also falls somewhat short of the interdisciplinary 

95 
definition of resilience and its related concepts, though it is clear that they are more closely 
aligned than the cyber texts.  
 
Time Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency Analysis 
 
At the level of an individual document, the statistical descriptors of the non-cyber texts, 
in Table 12 indicate that most terms did not have meaningful significance within the body of the 
text. The mean score was close to zero, though the average (mean) maximum score for a 
document was 0.722. Many of these documents are short compared to broader machine learning 
data sets, so lower scores are expected since the terms simply cannot repeat often enough to 
emerge with a higher score as they would be able to in a larger data set. The top 25 terms from 
the tf*idf analysis are shown in Table 13, below, and visualized as a word cloud in Figure 25.

Figure 25: Word cloud of the top 25 tf*idf terms from the corpus of twelve non-cyber texts. 
 
The tf*idf and word cloud analysis results indicate a much different corpus of texts than 
for the 37 cyber texts. The twelve non-cyber texts place a greater emphasis on change and factors 
beyond the organization’s control than for the 37 cyber texts.  
 
Latent Dirichlet Allocation Analysis 
 
The Latent Dirichlet Allocation analysis results in Table 14, contrary to the results in 
Table 9 for the 37 cyber texts, implicitly emphasize adaptation, change, and cross-scale effects. 
The set of topics generally addresses the time and scale aspects of resilience identified in the 
previous chapter. For scale, the topics address organizational, community, national, and global 

98 
aspects of resilience. For time, the topics address near-term disaster recovery to longer term 
recovery and adaptation.

Cosine Similarity Analysis 
 
The cosine similarity analysis shows that the twelve non-cyber texts have equivalent 
similarity metrics with the 37 cyber texts. The bulk of the documents had similarity scores 
between 0.2 and 0.4, with all documents falling between 0.1 and 0.7, as showing in the histogram 
in Figure 26. The pair index results for the twelve non-cyber texts, shown in Figure 27, indicate 
that the corpus of texts shares low similarity scores. The generally linear progression of the pair 
index shows no clustering of documents that would suggest greater similarity between a subset.

Frequency of Word Pairings: Bigram Analysis 
 
The same bigram analysis was repeated for the twelve non-cyber texts, with the results 
shown in Table 15 and Table 16, below. The bigrams strike a different tone than for the 37 cyber 
texts, with an emphasis on both traditional risk management and broader resilience concepts. The 
terms also appear in greater numbers, as expected for resilience-focused documents. Notably, the 
bigram “Security resilience” appeared in the list of top bigrams for the term “security,” which 
indicates a likely connection between security and resilience outcomes in the documents.

A Data-Centric Understanding of the Entire Document Corpus 
 
Intuitively, the sum of the two sets of text documents, the 37 cyber texts and the twelve 
non-cyber texts, should be the sum of their group results to this point, but since several of the 
methods, in particular Latent Dirichlet Allocation and cosine similarities, require the full corpus 
of text, the results will be slightly different. This penultimate section repeats the same analyses 
from the two separate blocks of texts. The final section of this chapter will make integrative 
observations about the development of the texts and the heuristic-based results on how well the 
37 cyber texts will address some or all aspects of cyber resilience.  
 

103 
Time Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency Analysis 
 
At the level of an individual document, the statistical descriptors of the non-cyber texts, 
in Table 17, below, indicate that most terms did not have meaningful significance within the 
body of the text. The mean score was close to zero again, though the average (mean) maximum 
score for a document was 0.858—closer to the maximum for the 37 cyber texts. The top 25 terms 
from the tf*idf analysis are shown in Table 18, below, and visualized as a word cloud in Figure 
28.

Figure 28: Word cloud of the top 25 tf*idf terms from the corpus of 49 texts. 
While the word cloud remains generally the same compared to the word cloud and tf*idf results 
from the 37 cyber texts, in Figure 22 and Table 8, the inclusion of resilience, business, 
community, and change show the influence of the non-cyber texts. The broad corpus of 
documents seems to align with cybersecurity best practices and not be significantly influenced 
by the interdisciplinary resilience research.  
 
Latent Dirichlet Allocation Analysis 
 
For the full body of texts, the Latent Dirichlet Allocation analysis strikes a balance 
between traditional cybersecurity subject matter but does exhibit several aspects of resilience in 
the topic list. In particular, Table 19 highlights topics related to investment and transition and 
community resilience, and topic 5 on regulation could be defined as both cyber- and resilience-
related.

Cosine Similarity Analysis 
 
The cosine similarity analysis does not reveal anything unexpected compared to the 
previous analyses of the individual sets of texts. The low similarity scores, with most falling 
between 0.1 and 0.4 (shown in Figure 29), indicate that each of the documents has a high degree 
of independence from the others. There is minimal redundancy between the different texts, even 
when adding the twelve non-cyber documents into the mix. Likewise, the pair index retains the 
same basic shape as the prior analyses showed (in Figure 24 and Figure 27). The lack of 
clustering in the pair index curve further reinforces the lack of independence between the 
documents, and the shallow slope follows the same shape as the individual results.

109 
Frequency of Word Pairings: Bigram Analysis 
 
The bigram analyses of the full body of documents shown in Table 20 and Table 21 skew 
heavily toward the traditional cybersecurity terminology. For documents that did mention 
resilience, the top ten bigram pairs in those documents are associated with core cybersecurity 
disciplines and practices. The addition of resilience-focused, non-cyber documents did assist in 
ensuring that cyber texts had the right pairings measured in them. Of note, the frequency with 
which major cybersecurity terms appeared indicates a strong tie between the cybersecurity texts, 
potentially diminishing aspects of resilience, which did not make the top ten terms for risk or 
security.

Brief Assessment of the Data-Driven Analysis of the Corpus 
 
This chapter began with a data-driven approach to building a dictionary of cyber and 
resilience terminology and finished with a holistic analysis of 49 cyber or resilience documents 
to gain insight into how well the words the interdisciplinary community uses with respect to 
resilience factor into cybersecurity guidance. The corpus of 37 cyber texts analyzed using tf*idf, 
word cloud analysis, Latent Dirichlet Allocation analysis, cosine similarity analysis, and bigram 
analyses reveal a body of cyber guidance that largely conforms to existing cybersecurity best 
practices.  
With respect to the time and scale aspects of resilience developed earlier in this chapter, 
the corpus of 37 cyber texts qualitatively trends towards the machine and organizational levels 

111 
for time and scale, respectively. Analysis using the dictionary and classification framework will 
be performed in the next chapter. However, the semantic analyses performed here indicate that 
few to no documents discuss cyber resilience across time and scale in a way that would 
correspond with the interdisciplinary research into resilience. This leads to the tentative 
affirmation of Hypothesis 4 in that the documents focus primarily on technical and 
sociotechnical cybersecurity and lack guidance on most or all aspects of resilience.
