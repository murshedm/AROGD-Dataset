CHAPTER 6:  CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE RESEARCH  
 
 
 
Conclusions  
With software serving as a central enabling technology that governs how we work, 
deliver value, and manage our lives, cyber defenders are tasked with designing, integrating, 
provisioning, and protecting systems that facilitate these outcomes. The growing number of 
users, both internal and external, that interact with those systems has expanded exponentially in 
recent decades. Reports of data breaches and other cyberattacks erode our trust in these systems. 
The guidance available to the cybersecurity community offers best practices for securing 
systems, planning for and responding to incidents, managing user trust and access, and numerous 
other topics. However, this guidance does not extend into the sociotechnical domain to help 
organizations understand how they should be operating to improve their cyber resilience.  
In the global cyber threat environment, organizations in all sectors must operate without 
setbacks. However, the cybersecurity industry's language can blur the lines among terms such as 
security, resilience, reliability, and robustness. This research conducted an extensive, 
interdisciplinary study of resilience to determine the central concepts that define it using 
statistical modeling tools and machine learning algorithms. The topical results from the Latent 
Dirichlet Allocation analysis (Table 4) provide a concise summary of what the interdisciplinary 
community defines as resilient:  
 Resilience is related to the system’s capability to handle stress and experiences in a 
positive light  

133 
 Resilience is related to the process a system uses to respond to stressful events over a 
time scale 
 Resilience is related to disruptive, impactful, and other extreme events and the ability 
to survive those events 
 Resilience is related to the ability and capacity for a system to change in response to 
an event 
 Resilience is related to a system’s functions across scales or a community (vice 
individual or organizational) in response to crises or stressors 
 Resilience is related to a system’s capability or ability to respond to a disturbance or 
stressor 
 Resilience is related to the ability of a system to recover within a given state 
 Resilience is related to a system’s capacity to absorb a disturbance, continue 
functioning, and change in response 
 Resilience is related to mitigating the effects of stressors through social capacities and 
the environment 
 Resilience is related to a system’s ability to respond positively under variable 
conditions 
 Resilience is related to a system’s ability to adapt in response to specified or 
particular shocks 
Thus, resilience cannot be easily defined with a single definition. Instead, it is best understood as 
a set of concepts that describe overarching emergent behavior. That behavior is highly dependent 
on the overall outcomes that the organization seeks—in a sense, it is a type of optimization 
problem. Biasing to be resilient toward one set of outcomes may make the organization brittle to 

134 
other crises that it is not primarily oriented to receive. Thus, general resilience may be a fleeting 
goal.  
 
 
Summary Review of Research Questions and Hypotheses 
 
Couched by the interdisciplinary study into resilience, this research sought to answer two 
primary questions: First, does a single strategy or guidance document exist to provide 
organizations at multiple levels of society with support for improving cyber resilience? Second, 
how do those existing documents address resilience? This generated four hypotheses with 
associated falsification criteria, and the analyses produced the following results.  
 Hypothesis 1 (H1): If no single document exists that addresses most or all aspects of 
resilience, then organizations will not have sufficient guidance to develop complete 
strategies to improve cyber resilience.  
o Falsification 1 (F1): A document exists that addresses most or all aspects of 
resilience as identified in the work to test Hypothesis 3 (H3).   
o Result: From the results in Chapters 4 and 5, summarized by Figure 31, no 
document exists that addresses most or all of the aspects of resilience. Thus, we 
can reject the Falsification 1 criteria and accept Hypothesis 1 as true.  
 Hypothesis 2 (H2): If one or more documents exist that address some aspects of 
resilience, then they can be leveraged and expanded to create a single document for 
organizations to improve cyber resilience.    
o Falsification 2 (F2): Hypothesis 1 (H1) is proven true.  

135 
o Result: Since we accept Hypothesis 1 is true, that satisfies the Falsification 2 
criteria. We must reject Hypothesis 2. No combination of documents exist that can 
be leveraged to create a single document for organizations to improve cyber 
resilience.  
 Hypothesis 3 (H3): If the existing documents incorporate most or all aspects of resilience, 
then there should be significant overlap with the interdisciplinary research and concepts 
on resilience.    
o Falsification 3 (F3): The analysis indicates gaps between the interdisciplinary 
concepts on resilience and the existing documents.  
o Result: The results of the tf*idf analysis, Latent Dirichlet Allocation analysis, and 
similarity analyses in Chapters 3 and 5 comparing the documents with the 
interdisciplinary concept of resilience validates the Falsification 3 criteria—gaps 
do exist between the two sets of work, which is ultimately evidenced in the 
acceptance of Hypothesis 1.  
 Hypothesis 4 (H4): If the existing documents focus primarily on the technical and 
sociotechnical aspects of cybersecurity, then the documents will lack sufficient guidance 
on most or all aspects of resilience.  
o Falsification 4 (F4): The analysis indicates few to no gaps in one or more existing 
documents.     
o Result: The mean time and scale values for the 37 cyber texts and twelve non-
cyber tests (the box plots in Figure 34) and the various contour plots presented in 
Chapter 5 all indicate a strong bias toward the technical and sociotechnical ends 
of the time and scale axes. We can accept Hypothesis 4.  

136 
In summary, the acceptance of Hypotheses 1 and 4 and rejection of Hypotheses 2 and 3 in 
this research leads to the conclusion that the existing body of cybersecurity documents, even 
ones that seek to provide guidance on fostering cyber resilience to organizations, lack a sufficient 
connection to the interdisciplinary conceptualization of resilience. Further developments will be 
needed to better address the aspects of resilience across time and scale to provide organizations 
with the necessary information and tools to develop strategies to improve their cyber resilience.  
 
Contributions 
 
This research makes several contributions in the areas of research on cyber resilience, 
practical contributions that organizations can draw on, and theoretical contributions from the 
methodology used. As stated in Chapter 1, this research expected to make the following three 
primary contributions toward cyber resilience and did so with the specified results.  
1. A classification framework from which future frameworks or guiding documents can be 
assessed for features of resilience—cyber or otherwise.  
a. Result: The development of a classification algorithm based on statistical 
modeling and machine learning techniques provides an algorithm that can be used 
to assess future cyber security or other resilience texts. It also provides a basis for 
continued development and refinement of the algorithm through expanding the 
dictionary and better or finer grained measurements for time and scale properties. 
The utilization of a standard data curation pipeline approach simplifies 
implementation on future texts.  

137 
2. An assessment of the existing frameworks and the extent to which the framework 
addresses some or all aspects of resilience as the interdisciplinary community 
understands it.  
a. Result: This research assessed 37 cyber security related texts encompassing 
narrow technical publications to sector- or industry-specific frameworks 
promoting resilience and found that no single framework adequately addresses 
resilience as the interdisciplinary community understands it. Of note, this research 
also analyzed twelve non-cyber, but resilience-related texts and found gaps in 
coverage from the interdisciplinary community’s understanding of resilience.  
3. Identify the gaps in the frameworks, or combined set of frameworks, to show where the 
cybersecurity community can focus future efforts on developing guidance to support all 
aspects of resilience, thus giving organizations the ability to develop strategies to 
improve cyber resilience. 
a. Result: Chapter 5 showed that the cybersecurity texts, as expected, primarily 
focus on the technical and sociotechnical aspects of cybersecurity, with 
insufficient to no coverage on some aspects of resilience.  
 
Practical Contributions for Organizations 
 
From a practical standpoint, organizations can use the results of this research to reframe 
resilience objectives and improve cyber resilience strategies. While not explicitly stated or 
oriented as such, this research makes three contributions that practitioners can leverage to 
improve organizational cyber resilience.  

138 
1. A coding scheme that can be used with a body of organizational documentation to assess 
the current language against the resilience and cybersecurity dictionaries, potentially 
providing a quantitative measure that can be used as a basis for measuring improvement. 
2. Identification of areas where existing cybersecurity guidance falls short of meeting 
resilience objectives, giving organizations the knowledge that their efforts may not be 
fully meeting expectations.  
3. A detailed development of what resilience is, and the set of behaviors or attributes that 
define resilient systems. The prior literature focuses on a singular definition of resilience, 
which can be difficult for practitioners or organizations to easily adapt to their specific 
situation or ecosystem. The decomposition of resilience from a single definition approach 
into a collection of attributes gives practitioners greater granularity, from which they can 
better understand how their organization measures up. There is future work in this area to 
further explore the connections with related concepts, such as high reliability 
organizations, system safety, organizational culture, etc. and how those bodies of work 
might link to and enhance organizational resilience.  
 
For the broader cybersecurity community, the natural progression of this research would 
be to begin mapping the controls in the 37 cybersecurity frameworks into a broader scaffolding 
around the major themes present. By aligning the controls with the attributes of resilience more 
narrowly, the community will be able to determine where existing controls meet the desired 
outcomes. The technical and sociotechnical controls, as presented in this research, ensure that 
those domains would be well-represented in this broader scaffolding, whereas the organizational 
controls, governance, risk, and compliance, and integration with the broader business strategy 

139 
and value proposition areas would likely need attention. In recent years, corporate boards have 
begun to realize their role in cybersecurity and its connection to delivering business value, but 
the debate on the proper role of the board, its ability to link business outcomes to cybersecurity 
lines of effort, and define the desired resilient attributes, such as the critical functions of the 
business and acceptance of certain thresholds for providing value, are still being debated. 
Fundamental to this debate is understanding what resilience is, determining how the organization 
would like to define its desired resilient outcomes, and understanding how to link existing 
cybersecurity processes to resilient outcomes.  
This research sought to provide the foundations of that next step, since the classification 
of existing cybersecurity controls onto the classification framework and identification of new 
resilience controls or practices must be explicitly tied to the organization’s desired resilience 
outcomes. Broad research across the cybersecurity and interdisciplinary communities is needed 
to develop a core set of resilience controls that most organizations can adopt, akin to what each 
of the cybersecurity texts, such as the NIST Cybersecurity Framework 2.0, sought to provide for 
security purposes. Development of these controls, as has been the case for development of 
cybersecurity standards, will involve much learning, debate, and experimentation to determine 
which controls are more effective. This will likely require the explicit bridging or integration of 
cybersecurity with traditional business domains, viewed through the lens of resilience.  
 

140 
Theoretical Contributions 
 
Finally, this research produced several theoretical contributions that are topical or 
methodological. These serve the research community by providing new insights or methods. This 
research made four primary theoretical or methodological contributions.  
1. The use of statistical modeling and machine learning algorithms on the interdisciplinary 
body of knowledge on resilience appears to be novel. The extensive literature review 
conducted to develop the resilience dictionary did not uncover any existing research that 
used this approach. The topical results from the Latent Dirichlet Allocation analysis, for 
example, summarize a large body of interdisciplinary research in a way that is not present 
in the existing literature. This approach may be useful in other areas of research where 
there is a substantial interdisciplinary component.  
2. This research expanded and integrated the concept of resilience by demonstrating that 
efforts toward a universal definition may not be as beneficial as coalescing around the set 
of attributes associated with resilient systems. The literature review did uncover several 
meta-studies on resilience, but the majority of these studies were focused on a singular 
definition with qualitative analyses.  
3. The development of a novel classification framework using the same statistical modeling 
and machine learning approaches with a data curation pipeline to conduct large scale 
semantic analysis of texts appears to be novel. While natural language processing and 
other semantic analyses are in widespread use, the literature review and associated 
research for this dissertation did not uncover any similar approaches to analyzing a 
corpus.  

141 
4. This research contributed to a broader understanding of the relationship between existing 
cybersecurity guidance and literature and the broader corpus of work on resilience, 
complex adaptive systems, and related concepts. This opens new opportunities for future 
research.  
 
Future Research 
 
This integrative study opens up multiple opportunities for future research. The integration 
of an already interdisciplinary field with data science techniques necessarily results in the initial 
development of new techniques and knowledge and should offer multiple avenues of new 
research as a result. This final section organizes those opportunities around the theoretical and 
the practical.  
 
Theoretical Opportunities 
1. Investigate and improve the classifiers for the time and scale aspects of resilience against 
cybersecurity applications. The use of a Fibonacci scale was only a first order 
approximation to convey non-linearity; there is opportunity to refine the scaling into a 
more quantitative system with true non-linearity, to include quantification of the adaptive 
cycles and panarchy.  
2. Improve and expand the resilience and cybersecurity dictionary. The initial GPT-aided 
classification of terms provided a starting point. There is ample opportunity here for 
qualitative and quantitative research into the classification of those terms.  

142 
3. Leverage and connect previous research into quantitative measurements of resilience and 
cybersecurity to develop this body of research into a quantitative system.   
4. Investigation into the “ideal” centroid or mean scores for time and scale values from a 
classification framework. It is assumed that an unweighted centroid with equal 
representation at all intersections will not be ideal since there should likely be a bias 
toward local times and scales, but identification of an ideal centroid position would be of 
value to the academic and practitioner communities.  
 
Practical Opportunities 
1. The large corpus of business-oriented books around human activities, such as strategy, 
sociotechnical systems, supply chain security and resilience, culture, etc. is ripe for 
evaluation with the classification framework. This provides the opportunity to link these 
bodies of knowledge into a coherent whole.  
2. Development of a cybersecurity framework that encompasses the majority of the time 
and scale attributes of resilience. Further, investigation into what types of 
recommendations or best practices can be truly scale free.  
3. Analyzing the roles of the sixteen critical infrastructure sectors identified by CISA with 
respect to the resilience attributes presented here and how they influence the adaptive 
cycles above (national to international) and below (sector and below) them [184].
