Interpretability
There is no standard or mathematical definition of interpretability
• Interpretability is the degree to which a human can understand the cause of 
a decision
• Interpretability is the degree to which a human can consistently predict the 
model's result
[Miller, 2019]

-
What is trust?
-
Is it simply confidence that a model will perform well?
-
Trust can be defined subjectively
For example: 
People may trust an ML model if they are comfortable with relinquishing control to it
People may not only care about how often a model is right, but also for which examples
it is right 
-
If the model tends to make mistakes on only those kinds of inputs where 
humans also make mistakes
-
If a model tends to make mistakes for inputs that humans classify accurately

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[End of Page 35]

36
Desiderata of Interpretability
• Causality
-
Machine learning models are optimized to make associations
-
They are expected to infer properties of the natural world (e.g., smoking 
and lung cancer)
-
The associations learned by models may not reflect causal relationships
-
Interpreting ML models can help provide clues about the causal 
relationships between associated variables

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[End of Page 36]

37
Desiderata of Interpretability
• Transferability
-
Training and test data are randomly sampled from the same distribution 
-
A model’s generalization error (transferability) is judged by the gap between its 
performance on training and test data
-
Humans exhibit a far richer capacity to generalize, transferring learned skills to 
unfamiliar situations

-
Humans exhibit a far richer capacity to generalize, transferring learned skills to

-
Interpretability provides insights on model’s transferability
For example: 
A model trained to predict probability of death from pneumonia assigns less risk to 
patients if they also had asthma
Reason: The patients with asthma received more aggressive treatment 
asthma
less risk of death from pneumonia 
Spurious 
correlation

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[End of Page 38]

39
Desiderata of Interpretability
• Informativeness
-
A model conveys information via its outputs
-
Interpretability can provide additional information to human users
For example: 
A diagnosis model might provide intuition to a human decision maker by pointing to 
similar cases in support of a diagnostic decision 
(skin cancer)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[End of Page 39]

40
Desiderata of Interpretability
• Fair and Ethical Decision Making
Politicians, journalists, and researchers have expressed concern that 
interpretations must be produced for assessing whether decisions 
produced automatically by algorithms conform to ethical standards

-
Predictions do not discriminate on race?
-
Accuracy or AUC (area under the curve) offer little 
assurance that ML-based decisions will behave 
acceptably
-
Demands for fairness often lead to demands for 
interpretable models

Why interpretability is important?
The more a machine's decision affects a person's life, the more important 
it is for the machine to explain its behavior

you are coughing and

Why interpretability is important?
Interpretability reveals the knowledge captured by the model
A recommendation system trained on a large dataset
• It is impossible for human to understand the data
• It is hard to decide whether the model prediction is trustworthy

Generally, we cannot satisfy both criteria 
because of the gap between model 
reasoning and human understanding
