With digital innovation and advancements in global information systems, the world has become more tech
savvy and interconnected. An example is the rise of smart cities, such as Dubai in the United Arab Emirates. In
partnership with government agencies and private-sector organizations, the Digital Dubai Office has over 130
initiatives intended to digitalize daily life in Dubai, making the city a better place to live as it becomes more
efficient and competitive in the world marketplace. This even includes an initiative to make Dubai the happiest
city on earth.1 Through this initiative, the city discovers what Dubai citizens need and want to be happy and
then uses technology to meet those needs. As a result, there have been robust changes in the city’s housing,
transportation system, and health-care services to promote Dubai citizens’ well-being.

geographically dispersed teams. The smooth interchange of information is critical to global business
operations. How is this accomplished? At the center of global information interchange lies a complex system
known as a global information system, an intricate network of hardware, software, data, and
telecommunications infrastructure that enables information collection, storage, management, processing,
analysis, and dissemination worldwide. Global information systems are the backbone of international
operations, allowing organizations to exchange information, communicate effectively, and collaborate. Global
information systems enable companies to overcome geographical barriers and tap into new opportunities for
growth and innovation through knowledge sharing.
As Figure 11.2 shows, a global information system manages and analyzes information across countries and
regions to support worldwide operations and decision-making. You can think of a global information system as
an information hub—similar to a library—collecting, storing, managing, processing, analyzing, and
disseminating information. The global information system is continually updated, providing real-time insights
across geographic boundaries.
Figure 11.2 The elements that make up a global information system are the methods, procedures, hardware, software, people, and
data to process and share global data effectively, which differentiate these systems from more local information systems.

A good example of a global information system is Tesla’s use of over-the-air (OTA) software updates. This
system lets Tesla update its cars remotely, thereby improving performance, adding new features, and fixing
problems without customers needing to go to a service center. The strategic impact of OTA updates is
significant: they keep Tesla’s cars technologically advanced and continuously improve the customer
experience, providing a key competitive advantage in the automotive industry. This system reduces costs
associated with physical recalls and enhances the long-term value of Tesla vehicles, demonstrating how a
global information system can facilitate cross-border collaboration and support sustainable growth in a
complex global marketplace.2

You may come across a similar term, “geographic information system,” often abbreviated as “GIS,” but this
type of system focuses on managing spatial or geographic data, including maps, satellite imagery, and
location-based information. Geographic information systems can analyze terrain data for urban planning or
track wildlife migration patterns, or support emergency response efforts. For example, during Hurricane
Helene in 2024, emergency teams used geographic information systems to analyze flood risk zones, prioritize
evacuations, and identify isolated communities.3 This real-time data helped responders prioritize evacuation
orders and deploy rescue resources. There are many important applications of geographic information
systems as a system themselves or as part of a global information system. A geographic information system
can be a component of a global information system, but the latter may also include enterprise resource
planning systems, global supply chain management systems, and customer relationship management
systems that manage global operations. Many examples related to geographic information systems reinforce
concepts that involve solving local problems, but the solutions can be applied to larger, more complex
problems around the world.
Global information systems play a different role. While global information systems may still include geographic
data, the main goal is to help individuals, organizations, and governments connect and collaborate across the
globe. An example of a global information system that many of us experience is Google Ads. When you search
for a product, such as running shoes, on Google, you might notice ads for different brands appearing at the
top of the search results. These ads are targeted specifically to you using data from your search history,
location, and online behavior, whether you’re in New York, Tokyo, or Paris. Google Ads allows businesses to
reach potential customers like you across the globe with personalized marketing, increasing the chances that
their ads are relevant, driving sales, and maximizing their return on investment.
The Role of Global Information Systems
Global information systems are essential components of modern society and play a critical role by enabling
organizations to coordinate operational activities on a global scale. For instance, Netflix uses a global
information system that leverages big data and machine learning algorithms to recommend movies and
shows to users across different countries, based on their viewing history, preferences, and behaviors.4
One use of global information systems is to track the movement of raw materials across various continents,
predict the path of a hurricane, or help you find the nearest shipping center. These systems are woven into
society, shaping everything from global business efficiency to disaster response effectiveness. They also
accelerate international expansion by providing organizations with the necessary infrastructure to enter new
markets, adapt to diverse regulatory environments, and compete globally. For multinational corporations,
global information systems streamline processes such as supply chain management, allowing for seamless
coordination of production, distribution, and logistics operations across borders. In addition, global
information systems support the standardization of business practices and workflows, ensuring consistency
and efficiency across global operations. Global information systems are useful for breaking geographic
barriers, facilitating global connectivity, and fostering global citizenship.
Global information systems can also allow companies to overcome geographical barriers by providing a
platform for sharing knowledge and resources regardless of physical distance. This opens new opportunities
by tapping into global talent—skilled professionals from around the world—which allows for collaboration,
leveraging diverse skills, and exploring new markets.
A global information system enables individuals, organizations, and governments to connect and collaborate
across vast distances. Through email, videoconferencing, social media, and other digital platforms, global
information systems have transformed how people communicate and share information, transcending local
barriers of time and location. For example, a medical team in Montreal can consult with a specialist about a

Another benefit of a global information system is that it can promote global citizenship by increasing
awareness of international issues and facilitating cross-cultural understanding. This is accomplished by
providing access to information, educational resources, digital tools, online forums, or interactive platforms
where individuals, organizations, and communities can actively engage in decision-making processes, share
knowledge, collaborate on projects, and contribute to discussions.
In addition to international connections, global information systems can grow businesses by nurturing
innovation and creativity, enhancing operational efficiency, and supporting informed decision making. Global
information systems encourage innovation and creativity within organizations. Global teams can collaborate
on projects, share ideas, and leverage diverse perspectives as they develop innovative solutions to complex
problems. For example, cross-continental meetings where teams work together in real time to tackle specific
challenges and prototype new ideas allow employees the opportunity to contribute ideas and refine concepts
collaboratively.
Global information systems can also support informed decision-making: In crises like natural disasters or
epidemics decision-makers need accurate, timely data to respond effectively. A global information system
integrates and visualizes data from sources like weather patterns, population density, and resource availability.
By providing clear, actionable insights, global information systems help decision-makers improve business
operations, policy development, and strategic planning.
Finally, global information systems streamline business processes, improve workflow efficiency, and optimize
resource allocation. Logistics companies—like FedEx, UPS, and DHL—can optimize delivery routes based on
traffic conditions displayed through systems, saving time and fuel, leading to cost savings and improved
customer service (Figure 11.3). Utility companies can pinpoint the source of outages by analyzing real-time
data on power grids and infrastructure, leading to faster repairs and improved service.

Let’s look at global information systems in action by looking at Nike. Nike uses global information systems to
manage its extensive global supply chain, which spans from factories in Vietnam to stores worldwide. Global
information systems enable Nike to track raw materials, streamline production, and optimize delivery routes,
ensuring timely and cost-effective operations. Beyond logistics, global information systems help Nike identify
new market opportunities, such as expanding into South America, by analyzing data to tailor marketing
strategies and product offerings. Global information systems help Nike manage inventory and track customer
preferences across various regions. This integration supports Nike’s e-commerce platform by providing
accurate inventory levels and efficient order fulfillment globally. Additionally, global information system data
allow Nike to tailor online marketing strategies and product recommendations based on regional trends and
consumer behavior, ensuring a personalized shopping experience and effective market expansion.5
Another example is the Real-Time Air Quality Index Visual Map that provides real-time information about the
air quality and air pollution in different regions of the world.6 The map helps those traveling to make informed
decisions concerning their destinations, especially if they have any form of respiratory disease.

Global Information Systems for Humanitarian Efforts
The United Nations (UN) uses global information systems to boost its humanitarian efforts around the
world. One notable example is during the Syrian refugee crisis.7 As millions of Syrians fled their homes to
escape conflict, the UN relied on geographic information systems to coordinate aid distribution, track
refugee movements, and plan the establishment of refugee camps. These allowed UN agencies and
humanitarian organizations to analyze satellite imagery to identify suitable locations for refugee camps,
considering factors such as accessibility, terrain, and proximity to essential services like water sources and
medical facilities. Working in conjunction, global information systems helped with the integration of various
datasets, encompassing not only geographic data but also nonspatial information from diverse sources,
such as demographic data, epidemiological data, health-care infrastructure, and disease transmission
patterns from multiple regions worldwide. This data-driven approach helped foster international
collaboration and cross-border coordination between UN agencies and other humanitarian organizations to
optimize the placement of camps to ensure efficient delivery of aid and support to displaced populations.
How Global Information Systems Differ from Traditional Information Systems
Consider a logistics company with warehouses scattered across the globe. A traditional information system
might track inventory levels within each warehouse but wouldn’t be able to show the bigger picture—the real-
time location of shipments, customer preferences based on location, or potential bottlenecks in the supply
chain. This is where a global information system comes into play.
Global information systems are designed to manage and handle the complexities of global operations. Unlike
traditional information systems, which are typically limited to a specific geographic location or organizational
boundary, global information systems excel at handling and managing data regardless of geographic location.
Characteristics that set a global information system apart from a traditional information system (Figure 11.4)
include its global reach, the types of data it works with, and its integration with other systems.

One of the key differences between a global information system and a traditional information system is their
scope of operations. While a traditional information system is focused on supporting the internal operations of
a single organization or a specific geographic region, a global information system is designed to facilitate
communication, collaboration, and decision-making across multiple organizations and geographic boundaries.
This allows users to see the entire operation across the globe, from bustling city centers to remote rural areas.
In addition, a global information system is equipped with advanced features such as multilingual support,
currency conversion, and internationalization capabilities to accommodate the diverse needs of organizations
worldwide. A traditional information system is typically designed for internal data management within a single
organization or a specific geographic region. An information system might track sales figures for all of a
company’s stores, but it wouldn’t inherently know each store’s physical location or how sales figures relate to
other factors like demographics or traffic patterns.
While both traditional information systems and global information systems manage data, they handle them in
a fundamentally different way. A traditional information system typically deals with structured data, such as
sales transactions or inventory levels, which are relatively straightforward to manage; they are organized and
categorized in a predefined format. Imagine a customer database that includes columns for a customer’s
name, address, phone number, and purchase history. Each piece of data occupies a specific slot, making it easy
for the information system to store, retrieve, and analyze. However, a traditional information system struggles
with the complexity of geographic data that come in a variety of formats. A global information system often
deals with unstructured data, which do not have a predefined organization, or semi-structured data, which are
somewhat organized but lack the fixed schema of a traditional database. Examples of unstructured and semi-
structured data include social media feeds, sensor data (information collected by a device that detects and
responds to a physical input, such as temperature), and satellite imagery. These types of data require more
sophisticated processing techniques, such as data mining, natural language processing, and machine learning,
to extract meaningful insights. Consider a utility company managing a network of power lines. A traditional
information system might struggle to analyze outages based on location. However, since a global information
system has the ability to model the network’s spatial layout, the company can pinpoint the outage zones and
identify affected customers much faster. This specialized data structure empowers a global information system
to unlock the full potential of location-based data for analysis and visualization.
Finally, a global information system is characterized by its ability to integrate and analyze data from multiple
410

sources, including internal systems, external databases, and the internet, enabling a more complete picture to
emerge. Sales trends can be analyzed alongside weather patterns, or delivery routes can be optimized based
on traffic congestion in a specific area. This integration capability is essential for supporting global operations
as it allows organizations to access and combine data from different sources to gain a comprehensive view of
their operations and make informed decisions.
Facilitating Communication and Collaboration with Global Information Systems
A global information system facilitates communication and collaboration across different locations by
transcending the barriers of distance, time zones, cultural differences, and language barriers. This
transformative power of global information system empowers organizations to operate seamlessly on a global
scale, a feat that was once considered nearly impossible.
Integration of Operations
A global information system enables organizations to integrate their operations across locations, facilitating
centralized data management, streamlined processes, and operational consistency. For instance, a
multinational corporation like Toyota leverages global information systems to integrate its manufacturing,
distribution, and sales operations across the globe.8 This integration is essential for achieving economies of
scale, reducing duplication of efforts, and optimizing resource utilization, which is the efficient and effective
allocation and management of resources such as time, money, materials, or personnel to achieve desired
objectives or outcomes. By harnessing global information system capabilities, Toyota is consistent in product
quality and operational efficiency across its worldwide operations. This is imperative for business
competitiveness and customer satisfaction, as well as for driving innovation and organizational agility.
Real-Time Communication
A global information system provides real-time communication tools such as email, instant messaging, and
videoconferencing, allowing employees in different locations to collaborate and communicate effectively.
Consider SpaceX’s international project team. Team members must communicate effectively, address technical
challenges promptly, and ensure project milestones are met on time.9 Global information system-enabled
videoconferencing and instant messaging tools allow real-time communication for coordinating activities and
resolving issues quickly, enhancing project success. An added benefit is that this technology can help foster a
sense of teamwork among geographically dispersed teams despite being separated by thousands of miles.
Access to Global Information
A global information system provides a wealth of global information including market trends, competitor
analysis, regulatory requirements, and cultural insights. This information is essential for making informed
decisions, identifying new opportunities, and mitigating risks associated with global operations.
Standardization of Processes
A global information system enables organizations to standardize processes and procedures across different
locations, ensuring consistency in quality, compliance, and performance. This standardization is essential for
maintaining brand reputation, meeting customer expectations, and achieving operational excellence. For
instance, multinational banks leverage global information systems to standardize compliance procedures
across branches worldwide, ensuring regulatory compliance and reducing operational risks.

Cost Reduction and Customer Satisfaction
A global information system can help reduce costs associated with global operations by enabling
organizations to optimize their supply chain, reduce inventory levels, and minimize travel expenses. FedEx, for
example, uses a global information system to reduce operating costs and enhance profitability while
maintaining service quality. By analyzing transportation routes and warehouse locations, minimizing shipping
distances, consolidating inventory, and optimizing resource allocation, FedEx can deliver expediently to its
customers, and this customer-centric approach is essential for building loyalty and driving repeat business.10
While a global information system can lead to cost reductions for organizations with global operations, it is
important to recognize that there may be higher costs initially due to the complexity of the system’s size and
its scope of connectedness. While global information systems offer cost-saving opportunities in future years,
organizations must carefully manage these complexities to ensure overall financial sustainability.
Improving Decision-Making Processes with Global Information Systems
Whether strategic, operational, or tactical, decisions influence every aspect of an organization’s performance,
from resource allocation to market positioning. In today's dynamic and competitive business environment, the
ability to make timely and informed decisions is essential for organizations to thrive and adapt to change. A
global information system facilitates comprehensive analysis, providing decision-makers with a holistic view of
the factors influencing their operations. For example, a retail chain may use a global information system to
integrate sales data with demographic information, helping them make informed decisions about where to
expand and how to increase their presence in the global market.
Visualization of Spatial Data
Visual representation is a powerful tool for understanding complex data and communicating insights
effectively (see 8.2 Foundations of Business Intelligence and Analytics). Within a global information system, a
geographic information system enables organizations to visualize spatial data through interactive maps,
charts, and dashboards. The term spatial analysis refers to the process of examining patterns, trends, and
relationships within geographic data to gain insights and make informed decisions about spatial phenomena.
By using spatial analysis, decision-makers gain valuable insights, visualize complex information, and develop
informed strategies. Imagine you have a map of your neighborhood with all the places where people have
complained about noisy pet dogs. Spatial analysis would help you see if the complaints are clustered in certain
areas or spread out. This way, you could find out if there’s a pattern, like if noisy dogs are more common near
certain types of homes or parks, helping you decide where to focus your efforts to address the issue. Another
example would be a city planning department using geographic information system maps to visualize
population density, land-use patterns, and transportation networks to inform urban development strategies.
Scenario Models and Predictive Analysis
Anticipating future trends and outcomes is essential for proactive decision-making. A geographic information
system allows organizations to assess the potential impacts of various strategies and courses of action by
conducting predictive analysis, which is the use of data, specifically statistical algorithms, to help
organizations identify patterns and make predictions that will enhance the operational results (see more about
predictive analytics in 8.2 Foundations of Business Intelligence and Analytics). By simulating various scenarios
and analyzing their potential outcomes, decision-makers can evaluate risks, identify opportunities, and
develop robust strategies to achieve their goals. Utility companies leverage GIS-based predictive analysis to
forecast electricity demand and optimize infrastructure investments, ensuring efficient resource allocation and
strategic planning.

Geographic Context and Spatial Relationships
Understanding geographic context, or considering the impact of location on operations, is critical for making
informed decisions, especially in urban planning, natural resource management, and emergency response.
For instance, a forestry company may use a geographic information system to assess the location and
distribution of timber resources, environmental constraints, and market demand. By incorporating geographic
context into decision-making processes, organizations can mitigate risks, optimize resource allocation, and
maximize opportunities for success.
FUTURE TECHNOLOGY
Geographic Information Systems for Emergency Response Planning
The city of Los Angeles stands out for its innovative use of geographic information system technology in
bolstering its emergency response planning processes, leveraging its functionalities at each stage with
precision.11 The city not only optimizes local emergency response efforts but connects to global resources,
such as best practices and disaster models. For instance, lessons from other earthquake-prone cities like
Tokyo inform how Los Angeles prepares its evacuation routes and resource allocations.
A geographic information system integrates a plethora of datasets from various sources, encompassing
population demographics, infrastructure locations, and emergency response resources into a centralized
platform. This consolidation provides decision-makers with a holistic view of the city’s physical features (like
roads, buildings, hospitals, and fire stations) as well as demographic data (population density, vulnerable
communities) and infrastructure elements (utilities, communication network)—in other words, the city’s
landscape—facilitating cross-disciplinary analysis and informed resource allocation to identify and address
gaps in emergency response readiness.
By visualizing critical infrastructure data such as hospitals, fire stations, and evacuation routes, alongside
demographic data, city officials communicate emergency plans to the public and coordinate response
efforts across various agencies. A geographic information system enables detailed scenario planning by
simulating complex disaster scenarios such as earthquakes and wildfires across the city’s vast and varied
terrain. Decision-makers evaluate the potential impacts of each scenario, leveraging spatial data to assess
resource requirements and communicate collaboratively. Notably, the city makes much of its mapping data
available to residents of the LA area, and facilitates neighborhood use of its geographic data.
The result is comprehensive contingency plans that are tailored to mitigate risks and ensure a coordinated
response. Through geographic information system platforms, stakeholders from different departments and
agencies throughout the city can share information, exchange insights, and coordinate efforts. A
geographic information system enables communication with international agencies when necessary,
extending its reach into a global information system and allowing for the integration of global best
practices and resources into local emergency response strategies.
Global Information System Infrastructure
A global information system infrastructure refers to the foundational framework of hardware, software,
data storage, network, and cloud-based services that support global information system operations within an
organization. It serves as the backbone for managing, analyzing, and visualizing spatial data to support
decision-making, operational efficiency, and strategic planning on a global scale. This intricate network, much
like the nervous system of a living organism, serves as the conduit for the flow of information that empowers
global communication, economic exchange, and organizational advancement. A robust global information

system infrastructure ensures reliability, scalability, and performance, allowing organizations to derive
maximum value from collective information.
The global information system infrastructure is built on the interconnection of local, national, and
international communication networks. This includes infrastructure like fiber optic cables, satellites, and
communication towers that transmit data and connect hardware devices, software applications, and data
storage systems across the globe. Reliable network infrastructure supports data sharing, communication, and
collaboration within global information system environments. The network infrastructure encompasses
network components such as routers, switches, firewalls, and wireless access points that facilitate data
exchange and collaboration. Common network architectures include client-server, peer-to-peer, and cloud-
based architectures.
Cloud computing services are accessible anywhere in the world with an internet connection, empowering
employees, partners, and clients to connect and collaborate in real time. Cloud providers work hard to ensure
availability of their services, meaning they are operational nearly 24/7, further enhancing communication
reliability. Storage area networks are high-speed networks specifically designed to connect storage devices to
servers. They allow for faster data access compared to traditional storage solutions.
Communication protocols are an established sets of rules that govern how devices communicate within the
global information system infrastructure. They define how data are formatted, transmitted, and received,
ensuring compatibility between different systems and software applications. Common protocols include TCP/
IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) and HTTP (hypertext transfer protocol) and FTP (File
Transfer Protocol).
An interoperability standard is a guideline, protocol, or specification that enables different systems,
technologies, or platforms to communicate, exchange data, or work together seamlessly. Security measures,
such as encryption and access controls, safeguard global information system infrastructure from unauthorized
access and breaches. Scalability and flexibility allow the systems to adapt to evolving needs and technological
advancements, while maintenance and support ensure optimal performance through updates and
troubleshooting.
ETHICS IN IS
Beyond the Essentials: Security and Safeguarding Data
Ethics in a global information system focuses on security and privacy. Interoperability standards ensure that
different systems can work together effectively, protecting user privacy and maintaining trust. These
standards provide a common framework for system compatibility and data exchange. Security measures,
such as encryption and access controls, are vital for preventing unauthorized access and protecting data
integrity. Together, these practices ensure that data are handled responsibly and ethically. Public health
agencies often rely on global information system infrastructure to help track and analyze the spread of
infectious diseases. Patient locations and demographics of reported cases allow for targeted interventions
and resource allocation.
Security measures like encryption and access controls are critical to protect data and ensure public trust.
Encryption scrambles data into an unreadable format, making it virtually impossible for unauthorized users
to access confidential information even if intercepted. Access controls determine who can view, edit, or
delete specific data within the system’s infrastructure. These controls can be implemented through user
authentication and role-based access permissions. It’s important to note that different organizations
maintain their own datasets, and protocols must account for this diversity in data management and
security.

Hardware
The global information system infrastructure also relies on a variety of hardware and software components to
function. Hardware includes computers, workstations, routers, and peripherals, such as cables, printers, and
scanners, and encompasses servers, storage devices, and end-user devices necessary for processing and
storing data. High-performance servers for data processing and storage are essential for handling the large
volumes of data exchanged in global operations. These devices handle the computational demands of
operations, enabling faster data processing, storage, and retrieval and enhancing the overall efficiency and
performance of workflows. Compared to traditional IT hardware, global information systems need more
specialized equipment. While standard servers and workstations are fine for general business tasks, global
information system hardware is designed for high-performance computing and large data storage. For
example, global information systems often uses fiber optic cables, which offer faster data transfer and less
interference than traditional copper cables.
Software
Software components include operating systems, communication protocols, and applications and tools
needed to create, edit, analyze, and share data effectively. A global database is akin to a vast library containing
information from around the globe. For example, a global database might keep track of environmental data,
like deforestation and pollution, which people across the world can use to make decisions. It serves as a
central repository that can be accessed and analyzed on a global scale. Robust data storage solutions enable
organizations to store and retrieve data efficiently, supporting real-time analysis, decision-making, and
collaboration.
Global information system-specific applications—such as those for supply chain management and customer
relationship management—allow organizations to navigate complexities, optimize processes, and deliver
exceptional value across their supply chains, customer relationships, and strategic decision-making endeavors.
A company’s supply chain management (SCM) software helps them manage goods and services from the point
of origin to the point of consumption. It includes tools for planning, sourcing, production, inventory
management, and logistics. This software provides real-time visibility into the supply chain, enabling
organizations strategize effectively. For example, Starbucks uses a global information system to optimize its
global coffee supply chain. By mapping coffee farms, tracking product quality, and assessing climate change
risks, Starbucks ensures a reliable and sustainable supply of coffee beans. This technology helps the company
improve efficiency, reduce costs, and support sustainable practices.12
A customer relationship management (CRM) software system encompasses the management of customer
interactions throughout their life cycle, aiming to enhance satisfaction and foster loyalty. A CRM merges data
from disparate sources like sales, marketing, and customer service into a centralized database. This
integration empowers organizations to delve into customer behavior, tailor marketing initiatives, and refine
service delivery. The benefits include heightened customer satisfaction and loyalty, increased retention rates,
expanded cross-selling and upselling prospects, and enriched insights facilitating informed decision-making.
Designing and Implementing a Global Information System Infrastructure
Building a robust global information system infrastructure requires thorough planning and execution to align
with an organization’s strategic goals and operational needs. Figure 11.5 shows the steps for designing and
implementing a global GIS infrastructure.

Step 1: Understanding the Organization’s Needs
Start by conducting a thorough assessment of the organization’s specific requirements, considering factors
such as size, geographic distribution, operational scope, and information needs. Decision-makers at Toyota,
for example, would consider the company’s manufacturing, distribution, and sales operations across
continents, with the goal of improving economies of scale and operational efficiency.
Step 2: Defining Clear Objectives
Establish SMART (specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound) objectives for the global
information system infrastructure that contribute to the organization’s business goals. For instance, SpaceX
could aim to increase collaboration efficiency among international project teams by 30 percent within six
months, with an anticipated result of a 15 percent reduction in spacecraft development time by the end of the
fiscal year.
Step 3: Assessing Technology Needs
Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment of technology requirements A needs assessment is the gathering
and analyzing of data to identify and evaluate the current state, areas for improvement, and interventions
needed to get to a more improved state It should include the following:
•
hardware and software needs
•
network infrastructure and security considerations
•
scalability and interoperability with existing systems
•
ability to handle future growth in data volume and users
For example, in a needs assessment, consumer goods company Procter & Gamble would consider the
technology requirements for accessing market trends and competitor analysis data in new markets. They
would evaluate the necessary hardware and software to support data analysis, ensure their network
infrastructure can securely handle the influx of data and users, and verify that their systems can scale and
integrate with existing platforms. This needs assessment will help to tailor marketing strategies and optimize
product portfolios.
Step 4: Selecting the Right Technologies
Based on the needs assessment, choose the most suitable technologies with cost, reliability, performance, and
vendor support in mind. Explore options like cloud services, enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems,
416

customer relationship management (CRM) systems, and other relevant applications, such as business
intelligence (BI) tools. For example, FedEx considered the cost, reliability, performance, and vendor support
needed to optimize transportation routes and strategically locate warehouses, minimizing shipping distances
and enhancing customer satisfaction.
Step 5: Designing the Infrastructure
In designing the infrastructure, carefully consider the following:
•
network setup
•
data storage and management strategies
•
robust security measures
•
comprehensive disaster recovery plan
•
scalability, flexibility, and the ability of the design to support future growth
The planning team for the city of Los Angeles would consider this list in designing a global information system
infrastructure that will use a geographic information system to visualize population density, land-use patterns,
and transportation networks in order to inform urban development strategies.
Step 6: Phasing Implementation
The infrastructure should be implemented in phases. Start with a pilot project to test the infrastructure and
use what is learned during the pilot to refine the system before a full rollout. Adding this step helps to correct
any issues and fix any bugs in the system before full deployment. Make sure to develop clear documentation
and communication plans and keep stakeholders informed. For example, the Federal Emergency Management
Agency launched a pilot program as part of its implementation for decision-making and response during
emergencies before rolling out the full program. The pilot program revealed ways to improve hazard
mitigation plans, such as methods to use artificial intelligence and provide communities with customized
disaster preparedness and response plans that meet citizens’ specific needs in a geographic area.
Step 7: Training and Ongoing Support
To ensure proficient use of the global infrastructure, it is necessary to train employees. This includes
developing and implementing user manuals and help desks to address initial challenges. For example, Target
has trained its employees to use a global information system to track customers’ locations in real time. With
this information, employees bring orders to the front of a store just in time to place the order in a customer’s
automobile as soon as they arrive at the store. Not only does this minimize the amount of time that customers
must wait, it also ensures that perishables, such as frozen goods, do not spoil while customers are en route to
pick up their orders.
Step 8: Continuous Monitoring and Maintenance
It is imperative to implement a regular monitoring plan to ensure optimal infrastructure performance.
Schedule routine maintenance to keep the system up to date with the latest security patches and ensure
smooth operation. Make sure any issues are promptly addressed to minimize downtime.
Step 9: Soliciting Feedback and Improvement
Actively solicit and implement user feedback to drive continuous improvement. This ensures the system’s
infrastructure evolves to meet the organization’s ever-changing needs, optimizing service quality and
efficiency.
Challenges of Managing a Global Information System Infrastructure
Managing a global information system infrastructure demands skilled navigation of various challenges, such
as data interoperability and accuracy, security and privacy concerns, legal and regulatory compliance,
infrastructure resilience, and disaster recovery mechanisms.
11.1 • The Importance of Global Information Systems
417

Data Interoperability and Accuracy
Ensuring data interoperability, accuracy, and compatibility across diverse systems and sources is a major
challenge. The ability of diverse data systems or formats to exchange, integrate, and interpret data accurately
and efficiently is considered data interoperability, and it often includes processes like data cleaning and
standardization (see Chapter 2 Data Management and Information Systems Business Strategies). The accuracy
of data is vital, and organizations may use a variety of software and data formats, making exchanging and
integrating data difficult. Managing the system’s infrastructure across regions requires hardware and software
platform compatibility. Optimization of the performance of global information system infrastructure is needed
to ensure that it meets the needs of users and applications. This includes monitoring performance metrics,
identifying bottlenecks, and implementing measures to improve performance, such as hardware upgrades or
software optimizations.
Security and Privacy
From customer demographics to classified project locations, an organization’s global information system holds
a wealth of sensitive information that needs protection. It is imperative to protect sensitive data from
unauthorized access and breaches and ensure compliance with data sovereignty laws and intellectual property
rights. Security tools such as encryption, firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and multi factor authentication
are crucial in protecting this data.
Infrastructure Resilience
To ensure a global information system’s infrastructure remains resilient in facing a cyberattack, organizations
must proactively prepare for the worst-case scenario and build systems that can weather the attack. By
implementing robust cybersecurity measures and fortifying the physical infrastructure, such as servers, data
centers, and networking equipment, from risks (such as natural disasters, power outages, theft), organizations
can minimize downtime, protect data, and keep operations running smoothly.
Cost and Scalability
A global information system infrastructure is complex, involving a wide range of hardware, software, data, and
networks that must work together seamlessly. Managing this complexity requires careful planning,
coordination, and technical expertise to ensure all components are integrated and functioning properly. Other
challenges with global information system infrastructure include cost and scalability. A global information
system infrastructure involves investments in hardware, software, data, and networks, as well as ongoing
maintenance and support costs. Balancing these costs with an organization’s budget and strategic goals is key
to staying on track. From budgeting wisely to optimizing resource allocation, keeping a keen eye on the
bottom line ensures the system’s infrastructure remains both effective and economical in the long run.
Additionally, a global information system infrastructure needs to be scalable to accommodate changing needs
and requirements. Anticipating future growth and capacity needs is important for staying ahead of the curve.
From expanding storage capacity to accommodating increased data traffic, having the flexibility to scale a
global information system infrastructure ensures that an organization is ready for whatever comes its way.
Building Versus Outsourcing Global Information Systems
The decision to build or outsource (or buy) a global information system is an important one in modern
business operations. Imagine that a multinational e-commerce company is seeking to expand its online sales
operations across different countries. The decision of whether to develop a custom system or to purchase a
pre-built solution to manage its global operations can have far-reaching implications on the organization. It is
important to assess the company’s existing information technology and information system infrastructures
and identify which current or external systems can be integrated with a new global information system. This
can help to reduce costs, improve efficiency, and avoid duplication of efforts. For example, a transportation
system could be integrated with a global weather system to improve delivery planning, optimize resource
418

allocation, and enhance customer satisfaction. By anticipating potential disruptions and making adjustments,
companies can minimize delays and ensure timely deliveries.
As businesses navigate this decision-making process, they must carefully weigh various factors to determine
the most suitable approach and to ensure alignment with organizational objectives. When considering
building a system in-house, an organization should consider these questions:
•
In addition to build costs, how much will integration, implementation, training, and ongoing maintenance
cost?
•
Can the company absorb the time it will take to build an in-house system, or are there time-to-market
considerations that may become a competitive disadvantage?
•
Does the business have adequate in-house expertise and resources to develop, implement, and maintain
an in-house system?
•
Are there intellectual property concerns that would be best protected by building a proprietary system?
Systems that are outsourced through a vendor or purchased outright require these considerations:
•
How much value will the company derive from a vendor’s expertise and services to implement and
maintain an outside system?
•
Are the system’s preset features sufficient, and if not, to what extent can the system be tailored to meet
specific needs?
•
What reputation do potential vendors have in terms of reliability, maintenance services, and technical
support?
•
Will a purchased system be compatible with and integrate smoothly into existing company systems?
For any of the options, the business should consider these important questions:
•
What are the year-over-year cost outlays of building versus purchasing or outsourcing?
•
Does one option or the other offer an advantage in terms of future scalability requirements and the
flexibility to adapt to changing business needs and technological advancements?
•
Will the migration of data into the new system be a smoother and better transition with one option over
the other?
•
How easily will the system comply with data protection regulations, industry standards, and the security
measures needed?
11.2 Global Information Systems Business Models, Logistics, and Risk
Management
Learning Objectives
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
•
Identify different types of global e-business models and enterprise strategies
•
Describe logistics issues, models, and strategies
•
Explain risk management and mitigation strategies associated with global data and systems sharing
As technology has transformed international business operations, e-business has become a vital tool, along
with robust logistics processes and risk mitigation for the global stage. In the global marketplace, information
systems are revolutionizing how these processes are handled, shaping the future of global organizations and
helping them use technology to be more efficient and competitive throughout the world.
Global E-Business
A global e-business refers to the use of electronic communication and digital technologies to conduct
business on a worldwide scale. It encompasses a wide range of activities including online sales, marketing,
customer service, and collaboration with partners and suppliers across the globe. Global e-business has
become increasingly important in today’s digital economy, enabling organizations to reach customers and
11.2 • Global Information Systems Business Models, Logistics, and Risk Management
419

markets beyond their traditional geographical boundaries.
The shift to global e-business has revolutionized how companies operate. Businesses can now reach new
markets and expand their customer base, streamline internal processes with online tools, and offer enhanced
customer experience through global support and personalized online interactions. Consider a sports apparel
company looking to compete on a global scale. Without e-business, they have limited market opportunities as
they are reduced to selling in physical stores only, restricting their customer base to their domestic market,
and limiting their brand awareness to their local market. With an e-business model, they can launch an online
store, reach new customers worldwide, and establish their brand as a global player.
Online platforms enable businesses to operate around the clock, catering to different time zones and
increasing sales opportunities. E-businesses often have lower overhead costs compared to brick-and-mortar
operations as they save on expenses like rent, utilities, and on-site staff. E-business equips companies to
compete effectively, streamlining operations, reaching new markets, and building a strong global brand in
today’s global marketplace.
Types of E-Business Models
An e-business model refers to the strategies and structures that businesses use to operate and generate
revenue online. Table 11.1 outlines some of the primary e-business models. Each model leverages the
connectivity and reach of the internet to create value and drive revenue.

Global Enterprise Strategies
A global enterprise strategy is a comprehensive plan outlining how an organization will achieve its goals and
objectives in a global marketplace, or the road map to an organization’s success. Developing and
implementing global enterprise strategies involve creating comprehensive plans that align with an
organization’s overall goals and objectives while considering the complexities of operating in a global
environment. Effective global enterprise strategies are important for companies seeking to expand their
operations and achieve success. Examples of companies with global enterprise strategies include Coca-Cola,
Toyota, Microsoft, McDonald’s, and Apple.
By developing and embracing innovative global strategies, organizations can unlock growth, navigate
complexities, and thrive in today’s interconnected world. Strategies might include the following:
•
reaching out to new customers and revenue streams beyond domestic borders
•
tapping into a global pool of talent, capital, and raw materials
•
spreading operations across regions to mitigate economic and political risks
•
gaining a global advantage through increased footprint and brand recognition
•
sparking creativity by accessing diverse ideas and best practices worldwide
•
establishing a strong, consistent brand identity across international markets
•
expanding responsibly, considering environmental and social impacts
To implement a successful global enterprise strategy, an organization should proceed through these steps:
1.
Complete a thorough analysis of the global business environment. This includes examining market trends,
competitor strategies, regulatory requirements, and cultural factors.
2.
Create clearly defined SMART (specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound) objectives for
global expansion.
3.
Outline the specific actions required to achieve the organization’s goals and incorporate the
environmental analysis and objectives. Include details on employing market entry methods, managing
cultural differences, addressing regulatory requirements, and building a strong global brand.
4.
Determine the resources needed. These resources include financial capital, human resources with
international expertise, and technological infrastructure to support global operations.
5.
Assemble a diverse and talented team to execute the global enterprise strategy. This team should include
individuals with expertise in international business, marketing, finance, operations, and other relevant
areas, depending on the specific industry and target markets.
6.

Global Logistics
The process of global logistics involves planning and managing the international transportation of goods to
their destination. Global logistics is how clothing, shoes, medications, health products, or food can be ordered
online and delivered to you a few days later. Global logistics entails detailed planning of how goods will be
transported, what routes to take, and how to navigate customs regulations around the world. It considers the
11.2 • Global Information Systems Business Models, Logistics, and Risk Management
421

transportation mix (air, land, and water means) needed for the efficient movement of goods, and factors
including cost, speed, and cargo type. It ensures the right amount of stock is in the optimal places with the
goals of avoiding stock-outs and minimizing storage costs. It uses technology to track shipments, manage
inventory, and ensure smooth communication across the supply chain.
Types of Logistics Models
Organizations employ different logistics models to efficiently manage the flow of goods, information, and
resources. These models each offer distinct advantages and come with their own set of challenges. Choosing a
suitable model depends on various factors, including the nature of the business, customer demand patterns,
geographical reach, and cost considerations. Three common types of logistics models are third-party, just-in-
time, and hub-and-spoke.
Third-party logistics (3PL) involves outsourcing logistics operations to a third-party service provider.
Outsourcing can reduce operational costs by leveraging the provider’s established networks and economies of
scale. These vendors manage transportation, warehousing, distribution, and other logistics-related activities
on behalf of the company. Providers of 3PL bring specialized knowledge and expertise, helping businesses
optimize their supply chain. They also offer flexibility in scaling operations up or down based on fluctuations in
demand without significant capital investment from the business using their services. Keep in mind that heavy
reliance on a third-party provider can pose risks if the provider faces issues or disruptions.
Just-in-time (JIT) logistics focuses on minimizing inventory levels by receiving goods only as they are needed in
the production process. This model strives to reduce costs and increase efficiency by lowering inventory levels,
reducing storage costs, and minimizing waste from unsold or obsolete products. JIT offers streamlined
operations, and reduced lead times can enhance supply chain efficiency, plus it promotes responsiveness to
market demand, reducing excess stock. However, JIT is highly sensitive to supply chain disruptions, and delays
from suppliers can halt production.
Hub-and-spoke logistics uses a central hub (distribution center) to consolidate and distribute goods to various
spokes (destinations). Centralizing distribution can lead to significant cost savings in transportation and
warehousing. Consolidation at the hub allows for efficient sorting, routing, and scheduling of deliveries,
allowing expansion of networks and increased volumes. Managing a hub and spoke network requires
sophisticated planning and coordination to ensure timely deliveries.
Why Use a Global Logistics Information System?
The implementation of a global logistics information system offers a compelling solution to several business
problems. A global logistics information system (GLIS) is designed to manage and track the flow of goods
across international borders, encompassing all aspects of a global supply chain. Imagine the transformative
potential of possessing real-time visibility into the entirety of the supply chain. This includes both a
comprehensive inventory overview and the precise location of every shipment in transit. Such transparency
empowers a proactive approach to problem-solving and facilitates the formulation of informed decisions
based on the most current data available.
The benefits of a GLIS extend far beyond mere visibility. It optimizes transportation routes to minimize costs
and delivery times and automates repetitive tasks, minimizing human error and streamlining operational
workflows. By providing accurate delivery estimates and proactively communicating potential delays, a GLIS
empowers an organization to become a customer champion. A GLIS equips organizations with the agility
necessary to adapt to the ever-evolving market landscape and seamlessly scale operations in support of global
expansion. The consequence of these improvements is a leaner and more cost-effective logistics operation
with a reduced risk profile. This is achieved through improved supply chain visibility, robust security features
that safeguard sensitive data, and the ability to leverage data-driven insights to optimize decision-making
across the entire logistics spectrum.

Global Supply Chain Management
Imagine you are managing the global supply chain for a company that designs cutting-edge athletic wear. The
framework of global supply chain management keeps this global operation running smoothly. It encompasses
everything from the first stitch to the final delivery, across international borders. The process of global supply
chain management (GSCM) involves the planning, coordination, and optimization of the flow of goods,
information, and finances across international borders to meet customer demands. It involves managing the
entire supply chain from sourcing raw materials to delivering finished products to end customers, taking into
account factors such as global sourcing, production, distribution, and logistics.
Types of Supply Chain Management Models
Choosing the right supply chain model is critical for businesses. It can affect everything from cost control to
risk management and brand reputation. Table 11.2 shows six common models that organizations utilize based
on the best fit for the company. There’s no one-size-fits-all model, and selecting the right one depends on the
specific industry, products, and business goals of the organization.

Table 11.2 Supply Chain Management Models Organizations should consider their strategic business goals, and the pros and cons
of different models, when selecting a supply chain management system.
Effective Supply Chain Management
Managing the supply chain effectively involves overseeing processes such as sourcing, procuring, producing,
and delivering goods and services to customers while optimizing costs, quality, and delivery times. Supply
chain managers need to develop strong relationships with suppliers as well as communicate regularly, share
information, and collaborate with partners to ensure timely delivery of high-quality goods and services. To
align production and inventory levels with customer demand, reducing stock-outs and preventing excess
inventory, companies need to consider historical data, evaluate market trends, and assess customer insights.
Managing costs is also a critical component of effective SCM. This includes using inventory management
practices to minimize holding costs while ensuring product availability that can meet customer demands. Risk
management is another important component of effective SCM, allowing for identification of potential risks
and supply chain disruptions in order to minimize their impact. One area that cannot be overlooked is the use
of performance indicators to monitor and measure supply chain performance so that areas of improvement
can be identified and addressed.
Challenges of Global Risk Management
Understanding global enterprise risk management (ERM) is essential for businesses working internationally.
For example, Uber uses a system for dynamic pricing, or surge pricing, which changes fare prices based on
factors like where riders and drivers are, traffic conditions, and past data.13 This system helps Uber manage
supply and demand. By adjusting prices in real time, Uber makes sure riders can get a ride when they need
one and encourages drivers to work in busy areas. However, managing this system globally comes with
challenges like ensuring data accuracy and following different regional laws.
The importance of developing and implementing effective strategic and global ERM strategies boils down to
two key concepts: proactive protection and sustainability. Enterprise risk management helps to proactively
identify and mitigate global threats, safeguarding an organization’s reputation, building resilience in a volatile
world, and ensuring avoidance of costly mistakes. Informed decision-making, optimized resource allocation,

and a competitive edge all stem from a strong ERM strategy that fosters sustained success.
Developing and implementing a strategic and global ERM strategy is essential for success, but it’s not without
its hurdles. Here’s a breakdown of the key challenges and considerations:
•
Gaining a comprehensive view of risks across a global organization: Data silos, cultural differences in
reporting, and complex supply chains can hinder risk identification and assessment.
•
Standardizing risk management practices across diverse geographical locations: Differences in
regulations, languages, and risk tolerances can lead to inconsistencies in how risks are identified,
assessed, and managed.
•
Failing to consider cultural differences can lead to misinterpretations and ineffective risk mitigation
strategies: Communication styles, legal frameworks, and risk perceptions can vary greatly across regions.
•
Implementing a global ERM program requires dedicated resources like personnel, technology, and budget
allocation.
•
Securing buy-in from all levels of leadership and employees is crucial for successful system
implementation.
By acknowledging these challenges, organizations can develop a robust and effective global ERM strategy that
protects their operations and fosters long-term success in today’s interconnected world. For example, in 2017,
global shipping giant Maersk fell victim to a cyberattack perpetrated by the NotPetya malware.14 Maersk
utilizes a complex global information system to manage its vast network of shipping containers, ports, and
logistics across the globe. The NotPetya attack, disguised as a ransomware, infiltrated Maersk’s global
information system and wreaked havoc. Terminals closed down, shipping schedules were disrupted, and
communication between locations became nearly impossible. This resulted in significant financial losses and
delays for Maersk and its clients. Moreover, the attack potentially exposed sensitive information within the
system, such as customer data, shipment details, and internal communications. The Maersk attack serves as a
reminder of the importance of robust security measures within global information system supply chain
management.
11.3 Culture in Information Systems and Global Information Systems
Teams
Learning Objectives
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
•
Describe the concept of culture and its impact on organizations and information systems
•
Explain the role of culture on technology adoption and use
•
Describe global information system teams
•
Explain what a cross-functional enterprise means to information systems
Culture is a set of rules and beliefs that shape people’s thinking and attitudes. It is important to understand
cultural differences and their importance in making technology work well in different situations. Culture
affects technology adoption and can influence whether people embrace a new technology or are reticent
toward change. For example, a global company might introduce a new global information system to
employees in different countries. In some cultures, there might be a preference for hierarchical decision-
making, while in others, a more collaborative approach might be favored. Understanding these cultural
differences is essential for ensuring that the global information system is implemented effectively and aligns
with local cultures.
The Impact of Culture on Organizations and Information Systems
Culture influences the values, norms, beliefs, and behaviors of individuals and organizations and plays an

important role in shaping the way technology is developed, implemented, and utilized in a company. Imagine
an organization with leaders who foster a culture of innovation and risk-taking. Employees are encouraged to
experiment with new ideas and embrace failure as a learning opportunity. What type of employee do you think
this company is looking to hire? Someone who values stability and prefers well-defined processes? Or
someone who is willing to take risks and experiment?
A broad and intricate concept, culture encompasses the beliefs, behaviors, customs, values, norms, symbols,
and practices shared by a group or organization. Culture defines that group’s way of life, shaping their
perceptions, interactions, and understanding of the world, including their approach to technology and
innovation. Culture is not static, but dynamic and ever-evolving, influenced by historical, social, economic, and
environmental factors.
An organizational culture refers to the shared values, beliefs, and norms that influence how people interact,
work together, and make decisions within an organization. It develops through shared experiences, leadership
styles, policies, and workplace practices (Figure 11.6). Organizational culture is critical in how new technologies
are perceived, adopted, and integrated into workflows. A culture that values innovation and adaptability is
more likely to embrace technological changes, while a more risk-averse culture may resist them.
Figure 11.6 Organizational culture can impact how an organization does business, especially when that culture is different from
other global businesses or varies across a single organization’s locations. (attribution: Copyright Rice University, OpenStax, under CC

A personal culture encompasses a person’s unique experiences, beliefs, and personality traits that affect how
they perceive and engage with their environment. An individual’s history, social influences, education, religion,
and reflections shape personal culture, which in turn can influence a person’s interactions with technology,
openness to new tools, and readiness to adapt to technological changes. Personal attitudes toward technology
can affect enthusiasm and proficiency in using new systems. Some of the significant ways that culture typically
impacts organizations include the company’s and individuals’ values and beliefs, norms and practices, power
dynamics, and approaches to decision-making and planning.
At the personal level, values and beliefs impact attitudes toward digital privacy, data security, and innovation.
For example, an individual’s belief in the importance of privacy may influence their preferences for secure
communication channels within information systems. Similarly, an organization’s values regarding
transparency, efficiency, and customer centricity inform their technological strategies and approaches to IS
implementation. These values shape organizational culture, driving technological initiatives and shaping the

digital environment in which individuals operate.
Norms and practices establish the rules and expectations regarding appropriate behavior. These norms may
include personal conduct in the workplace, such as punctuality or communication etiquette, and within a
global information system, these norms may include guidelines for online communication, data privacy
practices, and technology usage. For organizations, norms may encompass policies and procedures governing
employee behavior, teamwork, and decision-making processes. Norms may also govern IT security protocols,
data management procedures, and collaboration practices within global information system platforms.
Power structures and dynamics can influence access and control within information systems. While some
colleagues might prefer flat or shifting structures, others may appreciate a more hierarchal approach. Some
employees prefer working as a team, while others prefer working alone. In organizational cultures with
hierarchical power structures, access to IT might be restricted to certain groups, while more egalitarian
organizational cultures might strive for wider access. For instance, in some organizations with clear hierarchies
and those in power having more control and decision-making authority than others, only senior management
might have access to certain data systems. In an organizational culture that values creative input from people
at all levels, access might be more broadly distributed. The benefit of limited access to data systems for senior
management is greater control and security, but the drawback is that it may slow decision-making and reduce
employee empowerment. In more egalitarian cultures, broader access allows for faster decision-making and
increased collaboration, but it may pose challenges in maintaining data security and control.
Decision-making and planning approaches will also vary. More often than not, different perspectives lead to
creative solutions and collaboration enhances communication skills within the team. Keep in mind that
misunderstandings can happen when people don’t appreciate or respond thoughtfully to these differences.
Understanding organizational cultural dimensions is key to fostering inclusive design, promoting effective
collaboration, and ensuring that information systems serve the diverse needs of the global business
community. The cultural iceberg model, shown in Figure 11.7, explains how both visible and hidden cultural
elements impact the use of information systems within an organization. Visible aspects (above the surface)
include language, user interface preferences, and basic norms that can be easily adjusted, such as adapting
interfaces to local languages. Hidden aspects (below the surface) involve deeper cultural values like privacy
concerns, trust in technology, and decision-making processes, which can affect how technology and
information systems are perceived and used.

Culture and Technology Adoption
Organizations often encounter challenges when implementing new technologies, and these challenges can
expand when technology is implemented across diverse cultural contexts. Communication barriers pose
significant challenges and stem from differences in communication styles, languages, and norms across
cultural boundaries. These barriers can impede effective collaboration and understanding among team
members, hindering adoption.
Cultural resistance to change presents another obstacle, as individuals and groups may be hesitant to
embrace new technologies that challenge established practices or norms. Cultural misunderstandings further
complicate matters, as different interpretations of communication or behavior can lead to conflicts and
breakdowns in cooperation. Addressing these challenges requires organizations to proactively foster cultural
sensitivity, promote open dialogue, and develop strategies accommodating diverse cultural perspectives to
foster successful adoption of technology.
Cultural Factors that Influence Technology Adoption
Technology adoption is influenced by a variety of factors, and they can vary significantly across different
cultures. Understanding these is necessary for designing and implementing technology solutions that are
culturally appropriate and effective. Companies should consider the role of culture—organizational, regional,
personal, and so on—in their approach to how technology and information systems are adopted and
implemented. This includes attention to differences like openness to innovation, collaboration and
communication styles, language barriers, localization of information, and the digital divide.
Organizational cultures that prioritize innovation are more likely to embrace new technologies and invest in
their implementation. Those valuing stability and tradition may resist change and be slower to adopt new
systems or less open to workflow and process changes. Individuals who are early adopters and technology
enthusiasts can drive cultural change within the organization, promoting a more innovative and tech-friendly
428

environment.
Cultures encouraging collaboration and open communication facilitate the implementation of technologies
requiring teamwork. In hierarchical cultures where decisions are made by senior management and passed
down through limited communication channels, technology may be implemented without consulting end-
users. This can result in resistance and poor adoption. In flat and participatory cultures, where users are
actively involved in decision-making processes, technology is more likely to be embraced if changes include
attention to employees’ feedback and needs.
In a global organization, language barriers can lead to communication breakdowns that hinder data
interpretation and decision-making. Technology design should be mindful of possible language barriers and
the meaning of colors and symbols in the user interface. This includes menus, tooltips, and other textual
elements being effectively adapted for user languages. Organizations should also ensure data labels, attribute
names, and metadata reflect cultural nuances, and that users from different linguistic backgrounds can access
and comprehend vital information seamlessly. Direct translations can fail to capture linguistic nuances. A
system optimized for English-language acronyms might be meaningless in a French translation that uses
different acronyms or in a language with a different alphabet. Consider the example of Google Maps in India,
which supports transliteration of points of interest in ten local languages. This transliteration, which focuses
on converting the sounds and characters of one language to another (rather than translation of words and
their meanings), allows users to more effectively search for places within the software.15
Localization of information can create more value from systems. For example, incorporating local knowledge
into geographic information systems (achieved through cultural visuals like signs and symbols, community
mapping workshops, citizen science projects, interviews, and collaboration with local organizations) adds
another layer of richness and context to the data. Local users can provide insights that may not have been
captured in standard datasets. Integrating this information into systems enhances the relevance and accuracy
of spatial information and can foster a stronger connection between the technology and the communities it
serves.
Finally, companies should be aware of impacts of the digital divide. Cultures with better infrastructure, such as
electricity and internet connectivity are more readily equipped to adopt technology than those with limited
access. In a culture where technology has been more recently introduced, investment in training and support
programs can lead to better user adoption of new systems.

Cultural variations impact business practices and communication. In this TED talk, Valerie Hoeks discusses
cultural differences in business (https://openstax.org/r/109TEDHoeks) and offers practical examples and
strategies for navigating these differences effectively.
Identifying Cultural Barriers in Technology
Identifying cultural barriers in technology ensures successful implementation and user acceptance. There are
various ways to identify cultural differences to understand how these factors influence attitudes, behaviors,
and practices toward technology within an organization, including these methods:
•
Conduct cultural assessments: Utilize surveys and questionnaires to gather information on attitudes and
beliefs regarding technology. Focus groups and interviews with employees can be used to gather
information about the perceptions of and concerns about technology.
•
Analyze communication styles: Observe employees and use feedback mechanisms to identify differences

in communication patterns and barriers.
•
Skill assessment: Use assessments to evaluate current technological skills and literacy levels and to
identify gaps and cultural factors that affect training.
•
Evaluate the organizational culture: Use culture audits and surveys. Look at past technology
implementations and analyze the lessons learned to identify recurring issues. Consider engaging experts
to gain insights into cross-cultural communication and organizational behavior.
•
Use pilot tests: Prior to adoption, technology can be pilot tested on a small scale to identify cultural
barriers as well as gather detailed feedback from pilot participants to refine the adoption, implementation,
and use of the technology.
•
Use frameworks: Frameworks can be used by companies to identify and understand differences. For
example, Hofstede’s Cultural Dimension examines six factors—power, individualism, gender, uncertainty,
time, and control—to understand culture in the workplace (Figure 11.8).16 , 17

Designing Culturally Appropriate Technology and Systems
Global information system development often involves teams that span multiple countries and cultures. For
example, the International Space Station (ISS) represents an extraordinary global collaboration in the field of
science and technology. Five space agencies, representing fifteen nations, have worked together to build and
maintain the ISS.18 Effective cross-cultural collaboration is essential for successful global information system
development. This type of collaboration involves navigating and integrating diverse perspectives, values,
communication styles, and practices that arise from cultural differences, as well as a commitment to building
trust, communication, and collaboration across cultural boundaries. It is imperative that this collaboration is
facilitated by senior leaders. Following are some strategies for effective cross-cultural collaboration:
•
Foster inclusive leadership that recognizes and values the contributions of team members from diverse
cultural backgrounds.
•
Develop cultural awareness among team members to provide an understanding of the cultural values,
norms, and communication styles of team members.
•
Establish clear and open communication channels to facilitate understanding and collaboration. Use
translation tools and supports to ensure proficiency in a common language.
•
Encourage flexibility and a willingness to adapt systems development processes to accommodate different
cultural preferences and practices.
•
Develop and implement strategies for resolving conflicts that may arise due to cultural differences.

Implement platforms that support diverse languages, multiple time zones, and various cultural contexts.
Understanding cultural influences is essential for designing technology that is culturally sensitive, inclusive,
and effective in meeting the needs and preferences of stakeholders using the systems. Here is a list of key
principles to follow:
•
Research the cultural norms, values, and practices of your target users. Consider how these factors might
influence how they will interact with the technology.
•
Involve a diverse group of employees including differing cultures, genders, ages, abilities, and technical
skills, throughout the design process. Gather their feedback on features, language, and overall usability.
•
Use clear, culturally appropriate language in interfaces and instructions. Consider symbols, icons, and
metaphors that will resonate with employees.
•
Design technology that allows for customization. This could include different language settings, options
for displaying information, or adapting to local cultural norms. For example, a global e-commerce
business like Amazon.com allows users to customize their experience by selecting different language
settings, adjusting currency preferences, and choosing regional product recommendations to match local
shopping habits.
•
Ensure the technology is usable by employees with varying levels of digital literacy. Consider creating clear
interfaces, text-to-speech options, and support materials in multiple languages.
•
Consider the ethical implications of the technology. This includes respecting user privacy, ensuring data
security, and avoiding any form of cultural appropriation.
Global Information System Teams
Global information system teams play a critical role in organizations, especially in the context of cross-
functional collaboration. These teams are responsible for developing, implementing, and maintaining
information systems that support the organization’s global operations. Global information system teams must
collaborate closely to understand their requirements, align the system’s strategies with business objectives,
and ensure that the system’s solutions meet the needs of all stakeholders.
An organization’s global information system team is the group of professionals responsible for designing,
implementing, managing, and securing the complex systems that enable the flow of information across
international borders. Figure 11.9 shows the key roles in these teams.
Figure 11.9 Global information system teams typically consist of members from different functional areas within the company—such
as IT, finance, marketing, and operations—working together to achieve common goals. (attribution: Copyright Rice University,
OpenStax, under CC BY 4.0 license)
In terms of the technical management of global information systems and coordination with IT services, the
global information system team should ensure it has roles for these functions:
•
IT leadership: Sets the direction, allocates resources, and ensures IT aligns with business goals, including
policies, standards, budgets, projects, and compliance.
•
Regional IT: Manages IT operations and support in specific regions (infrastructure, user support, regional
11.3 • Culture in Information Systems and Global Information Systems Teams
431

projects, local regulations, culture).
•
Infrastructure: Designs, deploys, and maintains the organization’s global IT infrastructure (networks,
servers, data centers) for effective availability, performance, and security (cloud, resource optimization).
•
Applications: Develops, deploys, and supports enterprise applications used globally (development,
customization, life-cycle management, user support, integration, data integrity/security).
•
Data governance and compliance: Ensures data management practices follow regulations and internal
policies (data governance policies, data quality and integrity, privacy and protection, compliance audits).
•
Security: Protects IT assets and data from cyber threats (security policies, audits, monitoring, incident
response, security awareness training).
Since geographic information system teams are typically spread across various locations around the world,
managing such diverse teams requires key strategies such as the following
•
cultural awareness, where team members respect and navigate cultural differences
•
use of videoconferencing, chat platforms, and project management software to keep everyone informed
and aligned, considering time zone variations
•
open communication, idea sharing, and feedback through collaborative tools
•
defined team goals and roles that align with the organization’s vision statement
•
acknowledgment of accomplishments and rewards for outstanding performance
•
addressing of conflicts promptly and constructively, fostering open dialogue and seeking mutually
agreeable solutions
Cross-Functional Enterprises
Global enterprises need to navigate complex markets and diverse customer needs, and this is where a cross-
functional enterprise comes in. A cross-functional enterprise is an organization that breaks down
departmental silos and fosters collaboration between different functions (such as marketing, finance, and IT)
to achieve common goals. The most successful organizations abandon a siloed structure, where departments
operate independently, and create a collaborative network where departments work together as a cohesive
unit. This approach unlocks a range of benefits:
•
Diverse teams often generate innovative ideas and solutions.
•
Streamlined communication and collaboration eliminate redundancies.
•
Teams quickly mobilize resources to address new challenges.
•
Diverse perspectives can lead to well-rounded decisions.
•
Opportunities for cross-functional work can boost morale.
•
Enhanced efficiency, innovation, and agility fuel global expansion.
Cross-functional enterprises come in various forms, each with distinct characteristics and roles. Table 11.3
