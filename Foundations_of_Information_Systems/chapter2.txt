Introduction
The days when organizations relied on paper files and simple data processing programs to maintain records
and conduct business are long past. Technological advancements have given organizations the capability to
handle massive amounts of data in a digital environment. Data provide organizations with vital information to
improve efficiency and support competition in the marketplace. Businesses and other organizations must
manage data and information effectively to promote their success and to avoid data inaccuracies,
noncompliance with legal requirements, lost opportunities, increased costs, and dissatisfied customers. How
organizations develop and maintain robust data and which systems they utilize are important to
organizational success.

Data Management and Information Systems Business
Strategies

Organizations typically use digital technology to analyze data to get the information they need to run their
businesses. With the exponential increase in computing capacity and the development of artificial intelligence
(AI) and large-language models, businesses today rely heavily on efficient managers using sophisticated data
storage and data analytics technologies. How can you align your organization’s data management and
information strategies to deliver optimal results for the greatest number of stakeholders? Future data
managers will have an obligation not only to understand information and data management but also to
possess the ability to extract valuable insights from data, apply these insights strategically, and align them
with the organization’s goals.
In Chapter 1 Fundamentals of Information Systems, you learned that the term data refers to raw facts and
figures that are processed and turned into meaningful information. Data represent discrete elements without
context or meaning on their own, and data come in various forms—such as numbers, text, images, or audio.
For example, a list of numbers or a collection of customer names and addresses is considered data.
Information is the result of processing data through organization, analysis, and contextualization to derive
meaning. If the data are a list of numbers, then the related information may be the trend of increasing sales of
a product. This information can be used to make decisions, understand relationships, and gain insights.
For any organization, information is an invaluable resource, hence data and data management have become
critical. Effective data management aligns with data analytics capabilities, facilitating the automated discovery
of trends, patterns, and anomalies through techniques like data mining and analysis. In today’s data-driven
world, there’s increasing attention to the relevance of big data, highly complex and large datasets that require
specialized processing techniques to extract valuable insights and make informed decisions. Managing any
data involves activities such as cleaning, extracting, integrating, categorizing, labeling, and organizing. All
these activities should be executed in a manner that ensures that the quality of the data is preserved, and the
data remain secure but also easily retrievable. Organizations need people to manage data and control data
accessibility, and they need to define roles and responsibilities for all the people working with and extracting
information from their data. Decisions about data management have long-lasting impacts, so it is important
for organizations to select suitable frameworks for managing data.
Identifying Practices and Frameworks That Assist Data Management
Analysts report that by 2025 the global volume of data is expected to reach 200 zettabytes.1 A zettabyte is a
measure of digital storage capacity equal to a thousand exabytes, a billion terabytes, or a trillion gigabytes.
Notably, most of these data are underutilized. For most enterprises, only about one-third of data is used for
decision-making, while the remaining two-thirds is simply stored.2 When analysts are unable to find the
appropriate and available data for decision-making, it can cost organizations billions of dollars each year. On
the other hand, data archives are often required for regulatory reasons to ensure compliance with laws
governing data retention, privacy, and security. For instance, industries like health care and finance have strict
regulations regarding the retention of patient records and financial transactions data.
Another important aspect of dealing with data is data governance, which involves the policies, procedures,
and standards how an organization manages the availability, usability, integrity, and security of its data
throughout the data life cycle. You probably have noticed that every time you use the internet, an app on your
phone, or buy something online, websites and apps track what you do, and may track your location and other
data. The world is full of sensors, electronic payments, tracking data, biometric information like fingerprints,
and smart home devices that collect data. This kind of information is valuable, and this creates challenges for
making sure data are handled well. Data governance is like a rulebook for how data are managed and making
sure the right people are responsible for decisions about data.

Appropriate data management is crucial to an organization’s reputation and success. Data management
parameters establish practices that organizations can use to ensure that their data are managed, protected¸
and of high quality so they can be utilized to make informed decisions. The essential areas for managing data
effectively are as follows (Figure 2.2)3 :
•
Data governance establishes policies, processes, standards, roles, and responsibilities to manage data
as a valuable asset.
•
Data quality ensures that data are accurate, complete, and consistent. This is achieved through
activities such as validation, cleansing, matching, and monitoring via metrics and reporting.
•
Data integration combines data from different systems and applications. It includes tasks such as
mapping data elements, transforming data, and ensuring seamless integration using tools and best
practices.
•
Data security protects data from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or
destruction. It is achieved through measures like encryption, access controls, and adherence to
security best practices.
•
Data privacy, like data security, safeguards personal data from unauthorized access, use, disclosure,
disruption, modification, or destruction. It relies on the use of encryption, access controls, and privacy
best practices.
•
Data retention involves storing data for a defined period based on legal, regulatory, and business
requirements. It includes activities like archiving, purging, and the development of data retention
policies.
•
Data architecture focuses on designing data models and database structures that align with business
needs.
•
Data analytics involves analyzing data to extract insights and support decision-making. It includes
implementing activities like data warehousing, mining, and visualization to achieve meaningful
information extraction. These tools, techniques, and insights can be used in AI and machine learning
applications. (George Firican, ”Data Management Framework 101”)

FUTURE TECHNOLOGY
Data Management Technologies
A new approach to data management, called a data mesh, is based on the principle of domain-driven
design. In a data mesh, data are owned by the domain experts who create the data, and the data are made
available to other users through a self-service model.
Another powerful technique for data management is called data fabric. It involves a move toward data
democratization, which means that data are made available to more people in the organization, not just
those in information technology (IT) or data science roles. Through this approach, data can be accessed and
consumed by anyone as long as they have proper security credentials for the level of data they desire.
Another technology is federated analytics. Federated analytics allows users to analyze data without having
to move it to a central repository. This can help to improve data security and privacy, and it can also make it
easier to analyze data that reside in different locations. These three techniques address the growing
complexity and scale of data management in modern organizations, especially as data becomes more
distributed, diverse, and decentralized. These technologies provide innovative ways to manage, integrate,
and analyze data at scale, which is necessary in the age of big data and advanced analytics.

Businesses that strive to ensure they follow these data management parameters can decide to follow any
framework. A framework is a structured and organized approach that provides a set of guidelines, principles,
or tools to address complex problems or tasks in a systematic manner. It serves as a foundation to build and
manage processes, systems, or projects, ensuring consistency, efficiency, and effectiveness. Following are
some common data management frameworks:
•
DAMA-DMBOK: The Data Management Body of Knowledge, developed by the Data Management
Association (DAMA International), provides comprehensive guidelines across ten key knowledge areas,
including data governance, data architecture, and data quality.
•
MIKE2.0 IMM: This framework offers a structured way to assess an organization’s information maturity
level.
•
IBM Data Governance Council Maturity Model: This model provides a road map for implementing effective
data governance processes and controls.
•
Enterprise Data Management (EDM) Council Data Management Maturity Model: This comprehensive
framework covers various aspects of data management, including data strategy, data operations, and data
architecture.
•
Responsible Data Maturity Model: This model is an evolving concept that continues to gain importance as
the role of data in our lives becomes more prominent.
There are some differences in how each framework approaches data management. DAMA-DMBOK focuses on
the technical aspects of data management, while MIKE2.0 focuses on the business aspects of information
management. The IBM Data Governance Council Maturity Model and the EDM Council Data Management
Maturity Model are both designed to help organizations assess their current data management practices and
identify areas for improvement. The best framework for an organization will depend on its specific needs and
requirements. However, all five frameworks can be valuable tools for improving data management and
information quality. The optimal framework for managing data is one that is continuously developing to
address advancements in data storage and changes in organizational policy.
CAREERS IN IS
Data Architect
A data architect is responsible for designing, creating, and managing an organization’s data architecture.
This includes creating frameworks and structures for collecting, storing, processing, and accessing data in a
way that aligns with business goals, compliance requirements, and performance needs. In addition to
designing traditional data architectures, many modern data architects now also focus on frameworks like
data mesh, data fabric, and federated analytics as part of their responsibilities. A data architect needs
strong knowledge of database technologies, data modeling, cloud platforms, and big data tools. They must
also understand data governance practices, security protocols, and compliance regulations and be familiar
with data pipelines, integration tools, and extract, transform, and tools. Having strong problem-solving
skills will allow a data architect to design complex systems and solve integration challenges, ensuring data
flows smoothly across different parts of the organization.
Most data architects have a bachelor’s degree in computer science, information systems, business analytics,
or a related field. Some also have a master’s degree, which can help give candidates a competitive edge or
allow for a smoother transition from another field. There are also numerous certificates available for a data
architect. Different organizations may require different certifications, but the Certified Data Management
Professional certificate is one that many organizations prefer.
To become a data architect, you typically need a combination of a strong educational foundation, hands-on
experience working with data systems, and certifications in specialized tools and platforms. Ongoing
learning and keeping up with industry trends are also helpful in this rapidly evolving field.

Dimensions and Characteristics of Data to Inform Data Management
Decisions
For each type of data, an organization needs to define rules and policies to measure the quality of the data
and the effectiveness of the data’s management. There are four key dimensions of big data known as the four
Vs:
•
Volume: The dimension of volume refers to the vast amount of data generated and stored. Big data
datasets are incredibly large and can grow exponentially.
•
Variety: The variety dimension encompasses the diverse array of data types and formats, which might
include structured elements like user IDs, time stamps, and actions taken, as well as unstructured
components such as user comments and feedback.
•
Velocity: The rapid pace at which data are generated and collected, thereby necessitating real-time
processing, is characterized by velocity. Particularly evident during high-traffic events, such as online flash
sales, the constant influx of clickstream data necessitates swift analysis to enable the system to offer
tailored recommendations and insights to users navigating a dynamic digital landscape.
•
Veracity: The veracity dimension refers to the reliability, accuracy, and trustworthiness of the data,
considering factors like data quality and consistency. As data originate from a multitude of sources and
are influenced by user behaviors and tracking nuances, ensuring the quality of the data is imperative to
avoiding misinterpretations of metrics like bounce rates and session durations.
Different types of data are required for generating suitable information, and different types of data require
different management approaches. There are two main categories of data—structured and unstructured. The
first, structured data, exist in organized, fixed fields in a data repository. Structured data are typically defined
in terms of field name and type (such as numeric or alphabetical). Structured data can be further categorized
as follows:
•
Associated with operational or real-time applications, operational data include transactional data
generated by day-to-day business operations. Operational data often require high availability, real-time
processing, and quick access for operational decision-making. When managing operational data, the focus
is on ensuring data integrity, availability, and performance to support critical business processes.
•
Serving as a system of record or reference for enterprise-wide use, master data represent core entities
such as customers, products, or employees, and reference data include codes, classifications, or
standards used across the organization. Maintaining data accuracy, consistency, and synchronization
across multiple systems for these data types is necessary to ensure reliable and consistent information
across the organization.
•
Used for data warehousing, business intelligence, and analysis-oriented applications, analytic data
include aggregated and summarized data from various sources and enable in-depth analysis, reporting,
and decision support. Analytic data require data integration, transformation, and optimization to provide a
consolidated view and support complex analytics.
The other data type, unstructured data, do not reside in a traditional relational database; examples of
unstructured data generated within organizations are emails, documents, media (videos, images, audio), slide
presentations, social media activity (such as posts, images, ratings, and recommendations), and web pages.
There are several challenges associated with managing unstructured data. Their large volume can make them
difficult to store and manage. Unstructured data also come in a variety of formats from multiple sources,
including internal sources, personal sources, and external sources. Data can also come from the web in the
form of blogs, podcasts, tweets, social media posts, online videos, texts, and radio-frequency identification
tags and other wireless sensors. These technologies generate data that must be managed but are difficult to
process and analyze. Unstructured data are often generated at high velocity. This can make it difficult to keep
up with and make sense of the data.
Despite the challenges, managing unstructured data can be valuable. Unstructured data can provide insights

into customer behavior, identify trends, and improve decision-making. The management of unstructured data
involves organizing, storing, and retrieving such content effectively. Techniques like content indexing, search,
and metadata management are employed to enable efficient discovery and retrieval of relevant information.
When managing unstructured data, it is also important to understand the decision-making priorities of an
organization (which decisions require data and, consequently, necessitate data-driven information and
knowledge processing). Also, it is often possible to convert unstructured data into structured data.
Good data management strategies require the following:
•
Updating outdated data: A data management process should involve incorporating the latest information
and revisions into the dataset, thereby ensuring it remains relevant and accurate.
•
Rectifying known inaccuracies: Identifying and correcting any inaccuracies or errors in the data are crucial
to maintaining data integrity, which means ensuring data remain accurate, consistent, and reliable over
their entire life cycle.
•
Addressing varied definitions: Dealing with diverse definitions across different data sources requires
establishing a clear and standardized data definition, which is the instruction for how to organize
information. These definitions tell a computer system what kind of data to expect (text, numbers, dates)
and how the data should be formatted mapped to ensure consistency. For example, when the underlying
data point is the same (the person’s date of birth), the specific term used (“Date of Birth” versus “Birth
Date”) might differ based on the department using the data. However, the definition of the data point (the
actual date) needs to be consistent throughout the system to ensure accurate analysis and reporting.
•
Resolving discrepancies in redundant data sources: When multiple sources provide similar data, it is
important to reconcile any inconsistencies or differences to establish a reliable and accurate
representation of the information.
•
Managing variations in opinions, forecasting techniques, or simulation models: Recognizing and
addressing divergent viewpoints, methodologies, or models used for forecasting or simulation ensures
transparency and reliability in the data analysis process.
FUTURE TECHNOLOGY
Master Data Management
Master data management (MDM) ensures the creation and maintenance of a single, accurate source of
truth for crucial data points within an organization. This centralized data repository eliminates
inconsistencies and fosters seamless information exchange across different systems and applications. Let’s
explore the importance of MDM in two specific contexts: health care and e-commerce retail.
•
In the health-care sector, creating a unified, digital infrastructure for health-care services facilitates the
seamless exchange of health-related information among patients, health-care providers, and
government agencies. Efficient MDM ensures that patient data, such as medical history, medications,
and allergies, are organized, stored securely, and readily accessible by authorized personnel. This both
improves the efficiency of health-care delivery and reduces the risk of errors and delays in treatment.
•
In the e-commerce sector, consider a large online retailer managing millions of product listings.
Without MDM, product information like descriptions, specifications, and prices might be scattered
across different data sources, potentially leading to inconsistencies. Master data management
establishes a centralized repository for product data to ensure that customers see accurate and
consistent information across all interfaces: web, mobile, on-site, and in marketing materials.
Additionally, MDM facilitates efficient inventory management and product updates across various sales
channels.

Information System Planning and Management
Information systems play an important role in data management by transforming raw data into a strategic
asset. Information system planning and management involve selecting and implementing the right
technology infrastructure for data storage, processing, analysis, and governance. Information technologies
and systems play a vital role in facilitating data management within organizations, as they encompass
activities such as data acquisition, organization, storage, access, analysis, and interpretation. In the current
landscape, characterized by advanced information systems, quick and seamless access to information has
become the norm.
There is a distinction between information used for strategic planning and information used for management
control. An organization’s strategic planning is its process of defining the organization’s mission, vision, goals,
and objectives, and developing strategies to achieve them, often with the support of information systems,
typically done by senior-level managers. In contrast, management control ensures efficient day-to-day
operations and adherence to those strategic plans. The information required for each level serves a distinct
purpose; hence, the data required also differ. The data need to be in user-friendly formats, enabling managers
and analysts to easily comprehend and utilize the information according to their specific requirements (Figure
2.3). Managers, drawing on their expertise and experience while analyzing data, can effectively leverage these
insights to address complex business problems. This fosters a dynamic and adaptive approach of leveraging
collective data to drive continuous improvement and growth.

Consider an example within the energy sector’s need for sustainable energy solutions. To plan information
systems for a company in this sector, the chief information officer (CIO) must first understand what decisions
need to be made and, correspondingly, what data these decisions require—strategic planning, management
control, and operational control. The CIO should assess the different types of data currently available. These
data can come from various sources across operations. The focus should be on ensuring existing data capture
practices faithfully reflect what’s happening in the organization. Additionally, the CIO should consider how
these data can be processed and transformed into actionable information that supports the identified decision
needs. Finally, the CIO must assess how the different levels of planning and the different types of information
fit together.

Frameworks for Data Management Practices and Processes
In the realm of information systems, the Robert Anthony framework, named for the management accounting
pioneer who developed it in 1964, helps in understanding information needs across different organizational
levels. This framework categorizes decisions based on the level of certainty surrounding the problem and the
solution. The Robert Anthony framework divides a problem, and by extension the data needed to resolve this
problem, into three domains: operational control, management control, and strategic planning4 :
•
Operational control is the process of ensuring that the organization’s day-to-day operations are running
smoothly. It involves setting production schedules, managing inventory levels, and processing customer
orders. Operational control is typically done by frontline managers and employees.
•
Management control is the process of ensuring that the organization is meeting its strategic goals. It
involves setting budgets, monitoring expenses, and tracking sales. Management control is typically done
by middle management.
•
Strategic planning is the process of setting long-term goals for an organization. It involves identifying the
organization’s mission, vision, and values, as well as its strategic objectives. Strategic planning is typically
done by the organization’s top management team.
By classifying information into these categories, Anthony’s framework provides a structured approach to
gathering, analyzing, and utilizing information for effective planning and control within an organization. Table
2.1 features data characteristics for the three types of domains.
Domain
Data Use
Data Characteristics
Operational
Track and control day-to-day activities.
Data are typically detailed and time sensitive.
Management
Make decisions about how to allocate
resources and achieve goals.
Data are typically summarized and less time
sensitive than operational data.
Strategic
Set long-term goals and make strategic
decisions.
Data are typically aggregated and less time
sensitive than management data.
Table 2.1 Three Domains of the Robert Anthony Framework The three domains of the Robert Anthony framework—operational
control, management control, and strategic planning—each work with different types of data for different purposes.
Another data management framework developed by data scientist Herbert A. Simon in 1977, the decision-
making framework breaks down decisions into two types: programmed decisions with clear procedures or
nonprogrammed decisions requiring more judgment. Programmed decisions are also called structured
decisions as they are routine and can be made based on preestablished rules and procedures. They often
involve repetitive tasks that can be automated within the information system. Nonprogrammed decisions, on
the other hand, are not structured as they are unique and complex, requiring judgment, analysis, and
creativity. These decisions often arise when there are no predefined guidelines or precedents available. A
three-step process determines which activities are programmable and nonprogrammable (Figure 2.4):
1.
Intelligence: Gather relevant information and assess the situation to understand the nature and
requirements of the activities.
2.
Design: Analyze the collected information to make informed judgments about whether an activity can be
effectively automated or requires human intervention.
3.
Choice: Based on the decisions made, select the appropriate approach for each activity—either
programming it for automation or handling it through human involvement.

to a decision. (attribution: Copyright Rice University, OpenStax, under CC BY 4.0 license)
Another framework, developed by Gorry and Scott Morton, combines elements of both the Robert Anthony
and decision-making frameworks.5 Gorry and Scott Morton introduced the concept of IT into their framework,
acknowledging the influence of technology on decision-making and information management. They
highlighted the importance of aligning IT strategic planning with an organization’s decision-making needs and
the potential benefits that technology can bring to the decision-making process. Gorry and Scott Morton
suggest that for each business problem that involves information systems, data managers must first
determine whether the problem is strategic, managerial, or operational in nature and then see whether the
decision-makers and the intelligence required should be internal or external. If both the decision-makers
(stakeholders) and intelligence needed can be found internally, as in the case of order entry and budgeting,
then the problem qualifies as being structured. But if both the intelligence needed and the decision-makers
are external to the organization, then the problem qualifies as being unstructured, for instance, in the case of
systems for cash management or personnel management.
When applying the Gorry and Scott Morton framework to review existing systems or to propose new systems
that cater to user needs, an information systems designer or reviewer often investigates how available
technology can support decision-making. This framework emphasizes both applications and decisions,
necessitating input from a diverse range of users to understand the benefits of existing systems or
expectations for new ones. It is important to gather user feedback through structured interviews and
questionnaires as they can be utilized to collect user data and gauge user reactions to each system under
consideration. Key inquiries may include the following:
•
In which directions should the development of new systems be oriented?
•
Are there specific demands for enhanced strategic planning applications or managerial and operational
systems?
•
Do users want a system to support them with decisions that are less structured compared to those
handled by existing systems?
Furthermore, an analysis of previous systems developed in analogous situations could offer valuable insights
into the potential benefits of a novel system.

According to the Gorry and Scott Morton framework, management control primarily deals with overseeing and
guiding people, while operational control focuses on the performance of designated activities or tasks, such as
manufacturing a particular part. Typically, operational control systems have a limited ability to provide
managerial control reports or data that are helpful for strategic decision-making. For example, an online retail
system primarily focused on operational control can generate sales reports that may provide valuable data for
both managerial and strategic decision-making. Similarly, an online retail system primarily focused on
operational control can generate reports, such as a sales analysis report. While intended for operational
purposes, such reports can also provide valuable data for both managerial and strategic decision-making. For
instance, Zara has been able to use online retail system data for its supply chain management system to beat
competitors in the time to market by offering new fashions to its customer base.6 These data can be leveraged
to identify sales trends in specific regions, or product categories can inform decisions on marketing expansion,
inventory management, and product diversification to drive future growth.
To conduct a thorough examination of the information systems within an organization, a simplified Robert
Anthony framework can be employed. First, classify each system requirement based on the user and the type
of decision it supports—whether it pertains to operational control, managerial control, or strategic planning.
Then, for existing systems, consider factors such as data availability and the governance policies that regulate
access by decision-makers. This analysis should help identify whether the existing data align with the intended
purpose of the information systems and if any modifications or enhancements are needed. This process may
involve reviving outdated systems or proposing new systems.

In today’s ever-evolving business landscape, organizations have come to recognize the immense potential of
IT to enhance the value of their products and services. Leveraging IT has become a key factor in staying
competitive and relevant in the digital age. However, as businesses delve deeper into the realm of IT, they face
an essential question: How can they effectively assess the value IT adds to their organization?
Defining the Value of Information Technology Within Organizations
Over the past decades, businesses and managers have focused on understanding how to employ IT systems
to achieve goals in diverse organizational, consumer, and societal contexts. Transformative opportunities have
been ushered in with the emergence of a new generation of IT, including elements such as:
•
crowdsourcing platforms: online marketplaces where businesses or individuals can outsource tasks or
problems to a large, dispersed group of people
•
cloud computing: on-demand access to computing resources like storage and processing power
•
big data infrastructure: systems and technologies needed to manage and analyze massive datasets
•
AI: empowering machines to learn and make intelligent decisions
•
the Internet of Things: connecting everyday objects to the internet, enabling them to collect and share
data
Today’s IT systems have evolved and are used in handling tasks that involve high degrees of uncertainty and
take place in dynamic and unstructured situations. Some examples of these situations include cars driving
autonomously, chatbots supplanting customer service representatives, and email applications suggesting
writing improvements. This paradigm shift demands that we explore novel relationships between the strategic
value of IT systems and the performance of organizations.
The most common means of understanding the value of information systems in a business is to measure the
relationship between IT investments and output measures of revenue and human productivity. This evaluation
can be conducted at both the industry level and organizational level. However, the business value of IT goes
beyond direct output or revenue measures because IT often supports organizational redesign efforts, such as
the traditional taxi services being disrupted by new ride services like Uber or Lyft. This type of business model
innovation leverages IT to create entirely new business models, not just enhance existing ones.
Managers should consider which of the following three primary methods of value IT brings to their
organization (Figure 2.5):
•
automation of operation
•
information generation for managing people and resources
•
transformation of existing processes or combined tasks called routines

The automation of repetitive and mundane tasks via IT enables organizations to increase efficiency and reduce
human error. For example, automating inventory management processes can streamline supply chain
operations, leading to cost savings and improved inventory control. Automation can also enhance customer
service through the deployment of chatbots or virtual assistants that can handle routine inquiries and thereby
free up human agents to focus on more complex customer needs. For instance, Domino’s leverages IT to
automate tasks associated with delivery route planning, finding the most efficient delivery routes, reducing the
need for manual planning, and saving valuable time for employees.
Information generation through IT can also empower organizations to make strategic choices based on real-
time and accurate data, which can lead to better decision-making and increased competitiveness. Information
technology systems capture vast amounts of data from various sources, including customer interactions,
market trends, and internal operations. Through advanced data analytics and business intelligence tools,
organizations can derive valuable insights and make data-driven decisions. For instance, understanding
customer preferences based on data analysis allows businesses to tailor their products and services to meet
specific demands, improving customer satisfaction and loyalty. Domino’s utilizes various IT systems to
generate real-time data on traffic conditions, delivery times, and customer locations. By analyzing this data,
Domino’s gains valuable insights that inform decision-making. For instance, they can identify areas for
improvement in delivery routes or optimize staffing levels based on anticipated demand.
Through IT, organizations can transform and reimagine their products, services, and customer experiences.
The rise of e-commerce transformed the retail industry, allowing companies to reach an international audience
and provide personalized shopping experiences. Embracing cloud computing, AI, and data analytics can lead
to innovation and new revenue streams, ultimately enhancing an organization’s overall value proposition. For
example, Under Armour attempted to transform itself from a sports apparel brand into a holistic fitness and
wellness company through the acquisition of MyFitnessPal and the development of its own fitness app. It
planned for IT and its management to leverage data and technology to move beyond selling clothes and
become a central hub for athletes and fitness enthusiasts.10

moving forward.
An individual department or functional area within a large organization may have its own specific IT
application program known as a functional area information system (FAIS), an information system designed
to support specific business functions within the organization. These FAISs are designed to enhance the
internal efficiency and effectiveness of each department by providing valuable support tailored to each
respective department’s functions. These information systems often generate a diverse range of reports. Some
common examples of functional areas for FAIS include accounting, finance, production and operations
management, marketing, and human resources. The indicators of value listed in Table 2.2 signify the positive
outcomes and advantages that result from investing in IT within each functional area and system category.

Strategies to Improve the Value of Information Technology for
Organizations
Understanding the role of business processes within an organization is vital to measuring the specific value
that IT can deliver and the mechanisms through which it achieves this. Information systems professionals
know that technology alone is not the sole determinant of digital success, and that strategy is an important
catalyst in the digital domain. Business-IT alignment, or strategic alignment, refers to the strong integration of
the IT function with an organization’s strategy, mission, and objectives. This simply means that IT directly
supports the business goals of the organization. Successful alignment exhibits six key characteristics (Figure
2.6):
•
Organizations consider IT to be a driver of innovation that continuously transforms the business, leading
to new revenue opportunities.
•
Internal and external customers, as well as customer service, hold paramount importance for these
organizations.
•
Business and IT professionals are cross-trained and move across different departments and job roles.
2.2 • Strategies to Improve the Value of Information Technology Within Organizations
55

•
Clear overarching goals are established and understood by both IT and business employees.
•
Information technology employees are informed about the company’s revenue generation and cost-
saving mechanisms.
•
The organization fosters a vibrant and inclusive company culture.
Figure 2.6 Successful strategic alignment occurs when information technology directly supports the business goals of the
organization, guided by these six characteristics. (attribution: Copyright Rice University, OpenStax, under CC BY 4.0 license; credit

Unfortunately, many organizations struggle to achieve such close alignment. The primary reasons for the gap
between business and IT departments can usually be attributed to the following:
•
Different objectives: Business managers focus on achieving business goals and generating revenue, while
IT managers concentrate on technology implementation and maintenance.
•
Lack of expertise awareness: Business and IT departments often lack awareness of each other’s expertise
and perspectives, leading to misunderstandings and misalignment.
•
Lack of communication: Inadequate communication between business and IT executives hinders the
exchange of valuable insights and requirements.
Business and IT alignment as an integral unit, not separate entities, is vital. It is important that organizations
view IT as a strategic partner, not just a support function. By fostering collaboration and communication
between business and IT stakeholders, organizations can ensure that technology solutions directly address
business needs and objectives. To improve business-IT alignment, organizations can employ several
measures:11
•
Prioritize organizational communication: Encouraging effective dialogue between different departments,
fostering interdepartmental partnerships, and promoting mutual understanding between business and IT
teams ensures sufficient knowledge sharing, well-informed decision-making, and seamless collaboration.
•
Focus on strengthening governance: Organizations should involve IT in strategic planning to ensure
technology initiatives align with overall business goals. Engaging IT in executive committees enhances the
decision-making process. Implementing a structured reporting hierarchy establishes clear communication
channels, and defining authorization for decision-making roles ensures efficient execution. Coordinated
governance can help set criteria whereby IT projects are prioritized based on their alignment with
business objectives.
•
Align scope and IT architecture: Evaluating IT solutions for their effectiveness and customizing them to
suit specific scope and business needs can lead to better outcomes.
•
Emphasize the development of human skills: Cultivating readiness to embrace technological changes,
adapting management styles to support successful IT implementation, and learning from previous
experiences contribute to continuous improvement.

Case Study: High-Tech Stumble of UK Identity Cards
In the early 2000s, the UK government aimed to enhance national security, combat identity fraud, and improve
public services through the introduction of a comprehensive identity card. These cards would store biometric
data and personal details, providing a centralized system for identification. However, the plan faced fierce
opposition from civil liberties groups, privacy advocates, and political parties. Critics argued that the identity
cards would compromise individual privacy rights and lead to excessive surveillance of citizens. Concerns were
raised about data misuse, potential breaches, and the vulnerability of a centralized database to hacking.
Despite efforts to emphasize the benefits of the identity cards, the opposition prevailed, and the proposal was
eventually abandoned. The incoming coalition government decided that the proposal was too costly and
lacked significant advantages for national security, underscoring the misalignment between business and IT
strategies. Although the national identity card plan was discontinued, specific ID cards, like the biometric
residence permit for non–European Union nationals, were introduced as documentation of a person’s
immigration status.
The details of this case reveal a significant misalignment between IT and business perspectives concerning the
technological aspect of identity cards. Overall, the disparity between the UK’s simple, traditional ID cards and
the envisioned technological sophistication of the new cards highlighted the disconnect between IT and
business perspectives: the clash between a simple, efficient approach and the pursuit of advanced technology.
This case emphasizes the importance of fostering collaboration and understanding between IT and
stakeholders to develop practical and effective solutions for many different business scenarios.
Strategies to Generate Value Using Information Technology
In today’s business landscape, there are five key strategies usually pursued by organizations when seeking to
generate value using IT: cost leadership, differentiation, focus/innovation, operational effectiveness, and
customer orientation.
Cost leadership strategy is a business approach wherein a company aims to become the lowest-cost producer
in its industry or market. The primary goal of this strategy is to offer products or services at the lowest possible
price while maintaining acceptable quality levels. Walmart’s focus on cost leadership has allowed it to maintain
a dominant position in the retail industry. It consistently outperforms competitors by offering lower prices and
attracting a broad customer base, including price-sensitive shoppers. Despite its low-margin business,
Walmart’s sheer scale and operational efficiency allow it to generate massive revenue while maintaining
profitability.
Differentiation strategy is a business approach wherein a company seeks to distinguish its products or services
from those of its competitors in the industry. The primary goal of this strategy is to create a unique and
desirable offering that customers perceive as superior and are willing to pay a premium for. Apple exemplifies
the differentiation strategy in the marketplace. By designing sleek and user-friendly products, Apple sets itself
apart from competitors. The company’s focus on design, seamless integration of hardware and software, and
emphasis on creating a unique user experience differentiates its products in the market.
Focus/innovation strategy is a business approach wherein a company focuses on introducing new products,
services, or processes—or enhancing existing ones—to stay ahead of the competition and meet evolving
customer needs. The primary goal of this strategy is to drive growth and create a competitive advantage by
being at the forefront of innovation in the industry. Google is a prime example. Continuously introducing new
products and features, such as Google Search, Gmail, and Google Maps, the company revolutionized the way
people access and interact with information online.
Operational effectiveness strategy is a business approach wherein a company focuses on improving the
efficiency and effectiveness of its internal business processes to outperform competitors. The primary goal of
this strategy is to achieve higher productivity, quality, and customer satisfaction while reducing operational
costs and time to market. Amazon’s success is attributed to its operational effectiveness strategy. By
2.2 • Strategies to Improve the Value of Information Technology Within Organizations

optimizing its e-commerce platform, warehouse management, and delivery network, Amazon ensures efficient
order processing and swift delivery of products to customers.
Customer-oriented strategy is a business approach wherein a company places a strong emphasis on
understanding and meeting the needs, preferences, and expectations of its customers. Also known as the
customer-centric strategy, the primary goal of this strategy is to build long-lasting and loyal customer
relationships by providing personalized and exceptional experiences. Netflix thrives on a customer-oriented
strategy. Utilizing sophisticated algorithms and user data, Netflix offers personalized content
recommendations to each subscriber, tailoring their streaming experience based on their individual
preferences.
Each of these strategies has its pros and cons. For example, if a company focuses only on pursuing a cost
leadership strategy, it might not have enough resources for research and development, and so it might lag in
terms of innovation. Let’s say a company traditionally sells a one-size-fits-all software product, and they decide
to shift toward a customer-oriented strategy by offering customizable features and personalized support
options. A customer-oriented strategy impacts the scope, cost, schedule, risk, and quality dimensions of a
project. While a customer-oriented approach can lead to higher initial costs, it can also bring significant
benefits.
2.3 Digital Business Models
Learning Objectives
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
•
Compare digital business models and their design and integration components
•
Critique digital business models
The use of IT offers businesses numerous opportunities to generate value. Since most businesses adopt IT,
undergo digital transformation, or fundamentally change how the business operates and delivers value using
digital technologies, the digital field is crowded with apps, services, platforms, and digital devices. Some
businesses undergoing digital transformations thrive initially but then go bankrupt, and others pivot and
survive. Many established companies like retailers, banks, travel agencies, and print media have struggled to
survive in the face of digital disruption. Organizations confront a common challenge—the necessity to develop
digital business models that deliver value to customers or users. Thus, business models act as the vital
connector between technology and the strategic goals of an organization (Figure 2.7).
Figure 2.7 The business model is the key to bridging the gap between technological potential and business success, paving the way
for companies to thrive in the competitive landscape. (attribution: Copyright Rice University, OpenStax, under CC BY 4.0 license;

Defining Digital Business Models
A successful digital business model provides a logical framework that unlocks the value of a technology,
allowing businesses to benefit economically. The business model serves as a blueprint for how a company
generates and captures value from new products, services, or innovations. It is not solely IT that determines
success, but the business model behind it that plays a key role in enabling high-tech companies to achieve
their strategic goals and objectives. There are several common digital business models, each of which has
specific information technology strategies.
58
2 • Data Management and Information Systems Business Strategies

The e-commerce model involves buying and selling goods or services online through websites or apps, and
offers convenient shopping experience for various customer segments. Notable examples of companies using
this model are Amazon, Alibaba, and Shopify. In terms of IT strategy, a company using this model should
develop robust and secure e-commerce platforms to align with business objectives, such as providing a
seamless customer journey, implementing secure payment gateways, and optimizing logistics for efficient
order fulfillment. The organization should also align IT with marketing strategies to enable personalized
product recommendations and targeted promotions, ultimately driving customer engagement and loyalty.
The subscription model provides continuous value through recurring subscriptions that provide customers
with ongoing premium content or services. The IT strategy for this model is to develop products and/or
services, such as entertainment and transportation, that customers need routinely and are willing to make
recurring payments for to have continued access to the products and/or services. Amazon Prime and YouTube
are subscription models.
The freemium model provides a free basic service, with the option to upgrade to a premium version for
enhanced features or benefits, such as with the services offered by LinkedIn, DropBox, and MailChimp.
Integrating IT should involve designing services that showcase the value of the basic offering to entice users to
upgrade to premium features, such as a seamless onboarding process and data-driven user engagement
tactics. Companies should also optimize the platform to manage both free and paying users effectively.
Effective data analytics and user segmentation are necessary to identify potential premium users.
Collaboration with marketing and sales teams can be used to design targeted conversion strategies, monitor
user behavior to optimize premium feature adoption, and continuously improve the platform to increase
conversion rates and drive revenue growth.
In an affiliate model, one company earns commissions by promoting and selling other companies’ products
or services through websites or social media channels. They help drive traffic and sales, receiving a percentage
of the revenue from the companies they promote. Amazon Associates, ClickBank, and Commission Junction
use this model. These organizations should work with IT to build effective tracking and reporting systems to
accurately attribute sales to affiliates by implementing affiliate tracking software, optimizing landing pages for
conversion, and ensuring a seamless user journey from the affiliate’s site to the merchant’s platform. Providing
real-time data and performance insights to affiliates enables them to optimize their promotional strategies.
Amazon, eBay, and Airbnb demonstrate the marketplace model, which brings buyers and sellers together on
a single platform, with the enterprise acting as an intermediary that facilitates transactions between parties.
This approach fosters a diverse range of goods and services offered by different sellers, making it a convenient
hub for buyers. Effective IT strategy for this digital business model includes providing efficient search and
filtering options for users, securing payment gateways, personalizing recommendations, and offering robust
customer support systems that ensure smooth transactions and build trust between buyers and sellers.
Organizations using this model should also enable a user-friendly interface, smooth transaction processes,
and personalized product recommendations based on user behavior and preferences.
The advertising model generates revenue through targeted ads purchased by other businesses. Ads are
presented to customers when they view content, and since the content is supported by advertising revenue
paid by other businesses, customers view the content free of charge. This is the model for Facebook and
PeopleFun. IT strategy for this approach includes developing content that includes space for advertisements
that can be presented to users as they browse content, and selling this space to other businesses to run their
ads for an allotted time, based on the fees paid for the ads. Ads should be programmed and presented to
attract users’ attention while also providing minimal disruption to users’ interaction with content.
Kickstarter, Indiegogo, and GoFundMe operate through a crowdfunding model, which raises funds for a
product, project, or idea through an online platform, leveraging the collective support of the public. In this
scenario, contributors pledge funds to support initiatives and receive rewards or early access to products in
return. Entities utilizing this model should ensure their IT strategy is designed to build secure payment
2.3 • Digital Business Models

gateways, provide real-time updates on fundraising progress, offer personalized backer rewards, and
implement social sharing features to enhance campaign visibility and engagement. They should also ensure a
user-friendly platform for both project creators and contributors, enabling easy navigation and smooth
communication channels.
A sharing economy model involves individuals sharing resources or services through a peer-to-peer network,
enabling efficient utilization of underused assets. This fosters collaboration and convenience among users
seeking specific services or goods. Uber, Airbnb, and TaskRabbit are examples of companies using this model.
In terms of IT strategy, those with a sharing economy model should build robust peer-to-peer communication
systems that implement secure payment processing, real-time tracking features, and rating and review
systems to build trust among users. It is also important to prioritize user safety and enable efficient
communication between providers and consumers.
Finally, the digital product model offers downloadable digital assets that may include actual products, such as
e-books, or may be used to provide information such as education, assembly instructions, or details about a
product’s components. The offerings seen from TurboTax and Apple’s iTunes Store are digital products that are
downloaded. IT strategy focuses on developing products and services that can be delivered and used in an
electronic format. Companies should provide customers with a seamless process that enables them to
download products, such as software or music, or access services, such as an online class, on any device,
including computers, tablets, and cell phones. They should also enable real-time access, provide prompt user
support, and implement security protocols that ensure user safety when users download material or interact
online.
Today’s business environment has undergone significant transformations. Unlike the traditional stable and
low-competition business world, the digital business realm is marked by complexity, dynamism, and high
levels of uncertainty and competition. Consequently, in this intricate digital business setting, the business
model must be explicit and highly flexible to adapt effectively. Embracing change is important for effectively
navigating today’s business landscape.

Case Study: Transforming Health Care Through the Sharing Economy Model
The U.S. health-care industry faces a substantial inefficiency issue, with a large portion of capital expenditure
going toward medical equipment that remains underutilized. Boston-based Cohealo recognized the potential
of the sharing economy model to address these inefficiencies and created a platform that facilitates the
seamless sharing of medical equipment across different facilities. Cohealo operates as a cloud-based platform
supporting logistic capabilities and as an analytics-enabled information system that enables customers to
manage medical equipment centrally and make it available on demand. Cohealo’s products include the
following:

equipment across the network to support procedures wherever and whenever needed. This manufacturer-
agnostic design puts the choice in the hands of clinics, freeing up administrative time for patient and
physician care.
4.
Cohealo + Supply Chain: Cohealo streamlines equipment transportation, ensuring it reaches the required
location optimally and returns to the original site after usage. The network effect, fostered by health-care
institutions clustered in and around Boston, contributes to the success of Cohealo’s platform, enabling the
emergence of disruptive business models.
Several factors influence the success of the sharing economy model in the health-care sector, as observed in
Cohealo’s case12 :
•
Resource characteristics: Medical equipment, being valuable and commercial in nature, is considered
suitable for sharing.
•
Clustering of resources: The concentration of interconnected health-care companies and institutions in
specific geographic locations facilitates the easy transfer of use rights.
•
Use of IT: Online platforms enable easy and efficient mediation and monitoring of contract terms.
•
Cost advantage: The cost of accessing shared resources through Cohealo is often significantly lower than
the cost of ownership, promoting the adoption of the sharing economy model.
•
Institutional support: Factors like supply chain and logistics support, as well as governance considerations,
enhance the feasibility of sharing resources within the health-care industry.13
Digital Business Model Critiques
The emergence of digital business models has created the space for a workforce through online
platform–based work. While this has brought about innovative solutions for economic interactions between
people seeking jobs and employers, it has opened new challenges. With the sharing economy business model,
algorithmic reputation features play a central role in fostering trust and accountability. These reputation
systems, based on customer feedback and ratings, have been hailed as a valuable trust mechanism resulting
in efficient matches for a distributed workforce. Some criticism and challenges faced by digital business
models include14 :
•
Unequal distribution of opportunities: Research has shed light on a concerning phenomenon observed in
gig work platforms—the “rich get richer” effect. Workers with higher reputation scores and greater
experience tend to receive more work, as clients prefer to engage with those perceived as more reliable.
Consequently, this phenomenon results in an unequal distribution of opportunities, disadvantaging
workers with lower scores and less experience.
•
System of control: Algorithmic systems, though designed to foster trust, inadvertently create a “system of
control.” By standardizing metrics and homogenizing worker identities, platforms such as Uber or
DoorDash wield significant power. Platforms can manipulate scoring and matching algorithms to influence
job allocation decisions without involving the people using their platforms.
•
Opacity and lack of transparency: One of the most troubling aspects of algorithmic digital systems is their
opacity. Proprietary algorithms protected by trade secrecy laws prevent external scrutiny, leaving users in
the dark about the factors influencing their reputation scores or how changes to algorithms may impact
their job opportunities. In digital platforms such as Upwork, there is electronic monitoring of user actions

ETHICS IN IS
IBM’s Artificial Intelligence Ethics Initiatives
IBM provides a notable example of IS ethics in AI decision-making. IBM has been actively working on ethical
AI initiatives, emphasizing fairness, transparency, and accountability in algorithmic decision-making across
various domains such as hiring, lending, and law enforcement. IBM’s approach involves developing AI
systems that mitigate biases, ensuring inclusivity, and safeguarding privacy through responsible data
practices. Their efforts include implementing ethical AI frameworks, promoting diverse datasets, and
advocating for AI transparency and explainability to address societal concerns regarding algorithmic
fairness and discrimination.16

Learning Objectives
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
•
Describe a business process
•
Differentiate business process reengineering, improvement, and management
•
Discuss ways in which information systems enable business processes
To promote success, businesses and other organizations need robust business processes that are well
managed. Business processes help organizations be more efficient and effective—providing higher-quality
products and services, and improving customer service and satisfaction. Business processes can be tailored to
meet an organization’s specific needs, and information systems can be important tools to enhance business
processes.
Business Process
A business process represents a continuous series of interconnected activities aimed at producing a valuable
product or service for an organization, its business partners, and its customers. This process relies on three
essential components:
•
Inputs: These encompass the materials, services, and information that flow through the process and
undergo transformations as a consequence of the activities within the process.
•
Resources: People and other resources form the backbone of process activities, performing various tasks
to facilitate the progression of the process.
•
Outputs: Outputs are the ultimate result of the process, ending in the creation of a specific product or
service that is ready to be delivered to the intended recipient.
Consider the design of an information system for booking a COVID-19/flu/RSV test online. As shown in Figure
2.8, this business process includes procedures such as user registration, test availability search, appointment
booking, secure payment, test result reporting, and verification. The information system may prioritize data
privacy and offer reliable customer support to enhance user experience. Regular updates and maintenance
ensure efficiency and compliance with evolving guidelines. In general, efficient and well-designed business
processes are crucial for gaining a competitive advantage and ensuring organizational success. Such
processes must enable the information system to function innovatively and with enhanced effectiveness and
efficiency compared to its competitors. Conversely, poorly designed processes could become liabilities,
hindering the information system’s responsiveness and productivity.

Figure 2.8 Consider an example of booking a COVID-19/flu/RSV lab test through a mobile app. The inputs required from users are
personal information and preferred testing locations, and the outputs generated are confirmation of booked slot and test details.
Additionally, it involves identifying the resources needed, which in this case are testing facilities and health-care personnel, to ensure
a smooth and seamless process. (attribution: Copyright Rice University, OpenStax, under CC BY 4.0 license)
Providing an easy-to-use, up-to-date information system that delivers swift responses to user queries is
essential for attracting customers and increasing usage. Accuracy in displaying current information related, in
this case, to available time slots, testing locations, and pricing is crucial to building trust and reliability among
users. Conversely, an information system that fails to offer timely and accurate information or has slow
response times can have adverse effects on its success and reputation.
To assess whether the business processes of an information system are well designed, the first step is to
document the entire process. By analyzing this process, the organization behind the information system can
identify potential areas for improvement to gain competitive advantage, which refers to conditions and
circumstances that enable a company to compete more effectively than its rivals in a given market. A
competitive advantage helps an organization control a market and accrue profits.
Business Process Reengineering, Improvement, and Management
Table 2.3 identifies fundamental business processes performed in an organization’s functional areas. However,
there are several other business processes, such as procurement and fulfillment, that span multiple functional
areas. These processes are referred to as cross-functional business processes, where no single functional area
solely bears the responsibility for their execution. To ensure the successful completion of a cross-functional
process, each functional area involved must execute its specific steps in a well-coordinated and collaborative
manner.

Table 2.3 Business Process of Different Functional Areas There are numerous fundamental business processes performed across
an organization’s functional areas.
Organizations document any business process, and if any inefficiencies or bottlenecks are detected,
modifications can be made to optimize the platform’s performance and enhance user experience. In the
COVID-19 test booking example, modifications may include streamlining the booking flow, optimizing the
database for faster information retrieval, and ensuring the platform’s scalability to handle increased demand
during peak times. This is much like the e-ticketing process used in the airline industry. Here are some key
measures of excellence when evaluating the execution of a business process:
•
User satisfaction: Efficient and well-designed business processes can contribute to a more positive work
environment, leading to higher satisfaction and engagement of those using these processes.
•
Innovation: Streamlined processes can free up resources and time, allowing organizations to invest more
in research and development, leading to greater innovation.
•
Flexibility and adaptability: Agile and adaptable business processes enable organizations to respond
quickly to changes in the market or industry, enhancing their ability to stay relevant and competitive.
•
Cost reduction: By optimizing operational procedures and supplier processes, organizations can achieve
cost-cutting objectives, leading to improved financial efficiency.
•
Quality: The optimization of design, development, and production processes results in the delivery of
superior-quality products or services, which builds a reputation for excellence.
•
Differentiation: By optimizing marketing and innovation processes, organizations can create unique and
distinctive offerings that set them apart from competitors and help them establish a competitive edge.
•
Customer satisfaction: Attaining strong customer contentment is a direct outcome of streamlining and
harmonizing business processes to effectively meet the needs and preferences of customers.
•
Environmental impact: Optimized processes can lead to reduced waste and resource consumption,
positively impacting the organization’s environmental footprint.
•
Compliance and governance: Well-structured processes can ensure that the organization complies with
relevant regulations and governance standards, thereby reducing its legal and reputational risks.
How does an organization ensure business process excellence? One approach developed in the 1990s is
business process reengineering (BPR), which describes the radical rebuilding of core business processes to
2.4 • Business Process Management
65

achieve optimization. This strategic approach strives to expand the productivity and profitability of an
organization’s business processes. In essence, BPR requires organizations to scrutinize their business
processes through an unprejudiced lens and subsequently determine the optimal means to reconstruct these
processes to bolster their business functions. Business process reengineering originates from the capabilities
IT offers, including process automation, standardization of several process steps, and error mitigation through
improved interdepartmental communication.
Although some enterprises have effectively implemented BPR, a significant number of organizations found
this strategy to be excessively intricate and challenging to pursue. After encountering setbacks in BPR
implementation, businesses increasingly shifted their focus toward organizing work around business
processes rather than individual tasks. This shift led to a less disruptive and more gradual approach known as
business process improvement (BPI), which is the valuation of existing business processes to identify areas
for improvement. For instance, if a social media marketing platform were to experience a decline in click-
through rate (CTR), a metric that measures the effectiveness of an online ad or link, the organization’s BPI
team would investigate the root cause behind this issue. Likewise, if there was a broken machine on an
assembly line leading to output variations, the BPI team would analyze the process to rectify the problem. The
BPI team is composed of individuals with various roles and expertise. It typically includes the process owner,
process experts, subject matter experts, data analysts, and cross-functional representatives from different
departments. Continuous improvement specialists may also be part of the team, and a project manager or
facilitator leads the efforts. Stakeholders, including customers or end users, may also be involved or consulted
for their valuable input.
For example, consider a social media marketing platform that developed a campaign promoting a new
product launch. The initial CTR was 3.5 percent, and the marketing team aspired to improve this metric. By
using the BPI methodology, the team investigated the possible reasons for the low CTR. On analysis, it found
that the ads lacked visual appeal and failed to communicate the product’s unique selling points effectively.
Additionally, the team discovered that the targeting parameters needed refinement, as the ads were reaching
an audience that was not very likely to be interested in the product. Based on these insights, the marketing
team implemented the following improvements:
•
Ad creative enhancement: The BPI team collaborated with a creative team to design visually captivating
and compelling ad content that better communicated the product’s features and benefits.
•
Targeting refinement: The team revised the audience targeting parameters, focusing on demographics
and interests more closely aligned with the product’s target market.
•
A/B testing: To gauge the effectiveness of the changes, the team conducted A/B testing with different
versions of the ad, comparing their performances to determine which ones yield better results. An A/B test
compares the performance of two versions of content to see which one appeals more to viewers.
In addition to A/B testing, two popular methodologies used in BPI initiatives are design thinking and Agile. As
a methodology, design thinking, which is an approach to problem solving that uses creativity and empathy to
understand user needs in order to create user-centric products and services, has roots in the field of design
and was popularized in the 1990s by companies such as IDEO. The methodology involves empathizing with
customers to understand their pain points, defining the problem clearly, generating possible solutions,
prototyping and testing these solutions, and finally, implementing the most effective ones. For instance, a
financial institution may use design thinking to enhance its customer onboarding process. By integrating the
human-centered approach of design thinking, organizations can create processes that resonate with their
customers, improve user experience, and drive better business outcomes. The Agile methodology, as you’ve
learned, is used in software development and other fields, particularly for projects with rapidly changing
requirements and a need for frequent iterations, that emphasize flexibility, iterative development, and
collaboration. For example, a software development team working on a mobile application might employ Agile
to deliver incremental updates and new features in short development cycles (sprints). This iterative approach
allows the team to gather continuous feedback from users and stakeholders, ensuring that the final product

meets their evolving needs.
To sustain BPI efforts over time, organizations can adopt business process management (BPM), which is the
ongoing review and analysis of processes across an organization to identify opportunities for improvements or
reengineering that will optimize core business processes. BPM relies heavily on process modeling to show
stakeholders the dependencies between the people, systems, and information that interact to perform tasks
successfully. Along with business activity monitoring, this approach strives to make BPI initiatives more
congruent through optimization of core business processes.
Business process management begins with process modeling, which is a graphical depiction of all steps in a
process. Process modeling helps employees understand the interactions and dependencies among the people
involved in a given process, the information systems they rely on, and the information they require to
optimally perform their tasks. Business process management involves several key parameters that contribute
to the successful digitalization of business process initiatives within an organization:17
•
Strategic alignment: Business process management must be closely aligned with the organization’s overall
strategy. This alignment ensures that processes are designed, executed, managed, and measured in
accordance with strategic priorities, enabling continuous and effective actions to improve performances of
specific business processes. Business models act as the vital connector between the technology strategy
and strategic goals of an organization.
•
Methods: Business process management methods consist of tools and techniques supporting activities
throughout the process life cycle and enterprise-wide BPM initiatives. Examples include process modeling,
analysis, and improvement techniques with approaches like design thinking and Six Sigma, a quality
management methodology that utilizes statistical analysis to minimize defects and improve process
efficiency.
•
Culture: A supportive organizational culture enhances BPM values and fosters an environment conducive
to BPM success, although culture-related efforts may have a longer time horizon for significant impact
compared to other factors.
FUTURE TECHNOLOGY
Heathrow Airport and the Rise of Digital Air Traffic Control Towers
England’s Heathrow Airport, one of the busiest airports globally, exemplifies the challenges faced by
traditional air traffic control (ATC) methods. Managing the complex flow of aircraft relies on human
controllers stationed in a physical tower, with limitations in visibility and potential inefficiencies. For
decades, ATC has relied on a well-established system: Controllers stationed in physical towers utilize radar
and visual observation from windows to manage aircraft movements. While effective, this method has
limitations, such as sight being compromised by low visibility conditions like fog or cloud cover, existing
towers becoming geographically unsuitable as airports expand, the slowness and potential imprecision of
manual methods for estimating aircraft turnaround times, and a shortage of qualified air traffic controllers.
Digital ATC towers present a potential paradigm shift in air traffic management. These systems leverage
cutting-edge technologies, such as high-definition cameras that create a panoramic view of runways and
surrounding areas, AI-powered image analysis that can identify objects like support vehicles and overlay
radar data on each aircraft for easier identification, and machine learning that automates tasks like
turnaround time estimation and runway clearance in low visibility conditions, freeing up controllers for
critical decision-making.

Heathrow has actively explored the potential of digital ATC towers. In collaboration with NATS, the UK’s ATC
provider, they have implemented a trial system at the airport. This system utilizes high-definition cameras
and AI algorithms, demonstrating the potential benefits of enhanced visibility, improved efficiency, and
remote operation.18
Despite the promising advancements of digital ATC towers, there are challenges to consider. Regulatory
bodies like the Federal Aviation Administration in the United States have yet to fully certify digital towers,
hindering widespread adoption. Transitioning to digital towers may require retraining or relocating existing
air traffic controllers, potentially impacting jobs. And while AI can be a valuable tool, complete dependence
on automation could pose safety risks. Human expertise remains crucial. The digital ATC tower revolution is
in its early stages, but it represents a significant potential disruption to the traditional air traffic control
landscape.
Information Systems and Business Processes
By capturing and managing data, monitoring performance, and facilitating communication, information
systems contribute to improved efficiency, better decision-making, and overall business growth for any
business process. Following are the primary areas in which information systems play a vital role:
•
Capturing and storing process data: Capturing and storing relevant data generated during business
processes is one of the fundamental tasks of an information system. These data can come from various
sources such as transactions, customer interactions, and inventory updates. For example, a retail store’s
information system records each sales transaction, including the products sold, quantity, and customer
information. These data are then stored in a database for further analysis, reporting, and decision-making.
•
Monitoring process performance: Information systems are also responsible for monitoring the
performance of business processes. This involves tracking key performance indicators and metrics to
assess how well a process is functioning and whether it meets the desired objectives. For instance, an e-
commerce platform’s information system might track website traffic, conversion rates, and customer
satisfaction to evaluate the effectiveness of its online sales process. In some cases, these monitoring tasks
are fully automated. For instance, an information system can generate real-time reports and alerts when
certain performance thresholds are reached or breached. This automation ensures that the organization
can respond promptly to issues and make informed decisions.
•
Facilitating communication and coordination: Another important role of information systems is to
facilitate communication and coordination among different functional areas within the organization. As
businesses grow, the complexity of operations increases, and different departments need to work
together seamlessly. Information systems enable smooth information flow, allowing employees from
various departments to collaborate effectively. For example, a company’s enterprise resource planning
(ERP) system integrates information from different departments, like finance, human resources, and
supply chain, ensuring a coherent flow of data and streamlined processes.
It is important to be aware that the level of automation in these roles can vary. Some tasks are fully
automated, meaning the information system handles them entirely without human intervention. In contrast,
other tasks require human input, where the information system relies on the judgment, expertise, and
intuition of managers to make decisions based on the information provided.

Learning Objectives
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
•
Discuss digital innovation, and steps to create a digital innovation
•
Identify ways to integrate information technologies to innovate and transform an organization’s
offerings
Digital innovation continues to change the way we live. For example, Rio was a brand of portable digital audio
players, first introduced in 1998 by the Diamond Multimedia company. iTunes was a media player, media
library, and online store developed by Apple Inc. first released in 2001. In 2003, Apple introduced the iTunes
Store, where users could purchase and download digital music, movies, and TV shows. The key difference
between Rio and iTunes is that Rio was a dedicated hardware device (portable MP3 player), whereas iTunes
started as software that could be used on computers. This made downloading music easy and convenient.
Over time, Apple integrated iTunes with their iPod line of portable devices, creating a seamless ecosystem for
purchasing, managing, and syncing digital content between computers and iPods. Rio was unable to compete
with this new model, and the company discontinued them in 2005. Apple’s true innovation was the digital
innovation of making the downloading of music easy and convenient by leveraging technology. More and
more, organizations face mounting pressure to adopt digital technologies to revitalize and revolutionize their
business models and adapt to ever-evolving digital trends.
In 2020, the rapper Travis Scott teamed up with the popular online video game Fortnite for a virtual concert
titled “Astronomical.” This event was remarkable for its integration of virtual technology within the gaming
platform, attracting over twenty-seven million unique players who participated live across five days. It set a
significant benchmark for the future of virtual music festivals, showcasing the potential for immersive digital
experiences.19 Similarly, in response to the pandemic in 2020, the iconic event Burning Man transitioned to a
virtual “Multiverse” leveraging VR technology to re-create its distinct atmosphere. Through dynamic 3D art
installations, themed camps, and musical performances staged in various virtual locations, participants could
still immerse themselves in Burning Man’s ethos, highlighting the resilience of community spirit and cultural
exchange in a digital age. These examples illustrate how technology continues to revolutionize the way we
experience music concerts and festivals, offering immersive alternatives that transcend geographical
limitations and redefine traditional event formats. These VR concerts enable fans to experience performances
from anywhere in the world, breaking geographical barriers.
Digital Innovation and Its Adoption
In management information systems (MIS) scholars have identified two main perspectives on innovation and
its relation to IS. These perspectives offer valuable insights into how organizations adopt and leverage digital
technologies to drive progress. The first perspective, known as “IT innovation,” focuses on how organizations
integrate new IT-enabled business processes, products, and services. Simply put, this type of innovation refers
to the adoption of an already-existing IT product or service that is new to an organization.
The second perspective, digital innovation, centers on a product-oriented approach that examines how the
combination of physical and digital products leads to the creation of entirely new offerings (Figure 2.9).20 This
perspective also delves into the role of IT in facilitating or constraining the development of innovative
products. By studying digital innovation, we gain insights into how organizations structure and manage their
innovative endeavors more effectively.

Figure 2.9 The process of digital innovation follows distinct steps and is informed by the external competitive environment and the
internal organizational environment to produce the desired outcomes. (attribution: Copyright Rice University, OpenStax, under CC BY
4.0 license)
Digital innovation encompasses a range of activities that include initiation, development, implementation, and
exploitation. The first, initiation, involves the process of identifying and acquiring information on business
processes and requirements from both internal and external sources within the organization. The goal is to
find problems and opportunities that are well-suited for digital innovation—areas where implementing digital
solutions can lead to significant improvements or create new opportunities for growth. For instance, there may
be increasing demand for renewable energy sources and a need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. This
realization may prompt a company to explore opportunities in the renewable energy sector and invest in new
digital technologies to address these challenges.
Development focuses on the creation and design of new information systems. It encompasses various
activities such as building entirely new solutions from scratch, customizing existing systems to better fit an
organization’s needs, or adopting preexisting solutions that have proven to be effective elsewhere. The
development phase lays the foundation for digital innovation to be implemented successfully. For instance, a
company might invest in research and development to create advanced digital monitoring systems for its
offshore oil platforms. These systems should leverage cutting-edge technology to minimize environmental
impact.
Once the digital innovation has been developed, the implementation phase begins. This involves the actual
installation and deployment of the information system within the organization. Beyond the technical aspect of
installation, it also includes ensuring that the new systems are integrated into the organization’s existing
structure and processes. This may require setting up new governance systems, providing appropriate training
to employees, and establishing new processes to support digital innovation. This may also involve installing
digital systems in an organization’s satellite locations and providing the training its workforce needs to use the
technologies effectively. The organization may also offer incentives to encourage employees to adopt and
embrace the new digital tools.
Exploitation refers to maximizing the value derived from the existing information system. After
implementation, organizations leverage these systems to their fullest potential. This may involve reusing
existing systems and technologies for different purposes, finding innovative ways to utilize the data collected
by these systems, and continuously extracting value from the digital innovations to drive growth and
efficiency. For instance, after digital innovation has been implemented, a company’s new advanced monitoring

systems may not only improve safety and efficiency but now also provide new data insights. The company
could leverage this data to optimize its operations further, forecast maintenance needs, and enhance overall
performance.
Other important aspects of digital innovation are the internal organizational environment, the external
competitive environment, and the outcomes. The internal organizational environment refers to the
organizational backdrop in which digital innovation takes place. It includes factors such as the organization’s
business and data strategies, how data are managed and shared within the organization, and the established
business processes for doing things. The internal organizational environment heavily influences how
effectively digital innovation will be adopted and integrated into the organization. The external competitive
environment encompasses the broader market in which the organization operates. It includes factors such as
industry trends, market fads, the behavior of competitors, and the preferences of consumers. Understanding
the external competitive environment is crucial for organizations to ensure their digital innovations align with
market demands and offer a competitive advantage. The outcomes of digital innovation refer to the end
results achieved by adopting and implementing digital solutions. These outcomes can be either projected or
actual results. Projected outcomes are the anticipated benefits and improvements expected from the digital
innovation, while actual outcomes represent the tangible results realized after the implementation. These
outcomes often include new and improved business processes, innovative products, and more efficient
services that contribute to the organization’s overall success.
It is essential to note that not all of these components are mandatory in every digital innovation effort, and
they need not follow a prescribed order. In practice, these activities may intertwine to such an extent that it
would be challenging to distinguish them.
Deploying Information Technologies to Innovate
Given that not every company starts with digital products and services, nor can every company benefit from
them, the question arises: How should an organization pursue digital innovation or consider transforming its
products in the digital age? The simple answer is that developing an understanding of the unique context of a
business and adopting a well-defined framework can help the organization successfully leverage digital
technologies to enhance its products and services, foster growth, and remain competitive in the digital age. A
comprehensive framework that sheds light on how products and services can harness digital innovation
consists of three popular approaches: opening the door to third parties, connecting customers, and
connecting products in order to connect customers.21
Opening the door to third parties refers to creating an ecosystem that allows external developers and
businesses to integrate their products or services into the primary platform, thereby expanding its
functionality and value for end users. This approach can transform a traditional product into a robust platform
that caters to a broader range of needs and attracts a larger user base. Gojek is an Indonesian technology
company that initially started as a ride-hailing and courier service. Over time, the company recognized the
opportunity to expand its platform beyond transportation and ventured into various other services, including
food delivery, grocery delivery, parcel delivery, digital payments, and more. To achieve this expansion and
provide diverse services to its users, Gojek adopted the “opening the door to third parties” strategy. It created
an open platform that welcomes third-party service providers to offer their services through the Gojek app. For
instance, local restaurants can partner with Gojek to offer food delivery services, and independent drivers can
register to provide ride-hailing services through the Gojek platform.22 By integrating numerous third-party
services into its app, Gojek has become an all-in-one super app, catering to a wide range of everyday needs for
millions of users.
Connecting customers involves creating a platform that facilitates interactions and transactions between

customers, essentially forming a marketplace where buyers and sellers can connect with each other directly.
This approach transforms the product into a platform that not only serves customers directly but also enables
them to engage with each other, leading to increased network value for all participants. Instagram, a popular
social media platform owned by Meta, started out primarily as a photo-sharing app where users could post
pictures and videos to share with their followers. As the platform grew in popularity, businesses and individual
sellers recognized its potential as a marketing and e-commerce tool. To capitalize on this opportunity,
Instagram introduced Instagram Shopping, which allows businesses and individual sellers to set up virtual
shops directly on the platform, showcasing their products through photos and videos. Users can explore these
shops, browse products, and make purchases without leaving the app. By enabling this direct connection
between sellers and potential buyers, Instagram became more than just a social media platform—it became a
thriving marketplace where businesses could reach a large audience and customers could discover and
purchase products seamlessly.
Connecting products to connect customers involves creating a platform that connects various products or
services to offer a comprehensive and seamless experience to customers. This approach aims to provide
customers with a unified ecosystem where different products work together harmoniously, creating
convenience and value for users. By connecting products, companies can strengthen customer loyalty,
increase engagement, and establish a dominant position in their respective markets. Microsoft’s Windows
operating system exemplifies the strategy of connecting products to connect customers. Windows is a
platform that serves as the foundation for running a wide variety of software applications on personal
computers. Microsoft recognized that by creating a unified ecosystem and connecting different software
products to the Windows platform, it could increase its value and attract a larger user base. As a result, a vast
array of applications, ranging from productivity tools to creative software and games, were made available to
Windows users. This interconnected ecosystem made Windows an indispensable platform for PC users, as they
could seamlessly install and use various software products for their specific needs. The availability of a diverse
selection of software products contributed to the success and widespread adoption of the Windows operating
system.

Summary
2.1 Practices and Frameworks for Data Management
•
Data governance involves establishing policies, processes, standards, roles, and responsibilities to manage
data as a valuable asset. One important part of data governance is information quality, which covers how
accurate, complete, consistent, and readily accessible it is.
•
Data management is about figuring out the specific ways that data will be stored, analyzed, protected, and
measured.
•
Data quality involves ensuring that data are accurate, complete, and consistent.
•
The four key dimensions of big data—known as the four Vs—include volume, variety, velocity, and veracity.
•
Different types of data are required for generating suitable information, and different types of data
require different management approaches. There are two main categories of data: structured data and
unstructured data.
•
Good data management strategies require updating outdated data, rectifying known inaccuracies,
addressing varied definitions, resolving discrepancies in redundant data sources, and managing variations
in opinions, forecasting techniques, or simulation models.
•
Information systems planning and management involve selecting and implementing the right technology
infrastructure for data storage, processing, analysis, and governance.
•
There is a distinction between information used for strategic planning and information used for
management control. Strategic planning focuses on the long-term goals and direction of the company,
while management control ensures efficient day-to-day operations and adherence to those strategic
plans.
•
Foundational frameworks include the Robert Anthony framework, Herbert A. Simon’s decision-making
framework, and Gorry and Scott Morton’s framework, which combines elements of both the Robert
Anthony framework and Simon’s decision-making frameworks.
2.2 Strategies to Improve the Value of Information Technology Within
Organizations
•
Information technology systems are used in handling tasks that involve high degrees of uncertainty and
take place in dynamic and unstructured situations.
•
The most common means of understanding the value of IS in a business is to measure the relationship
between IT investments and output measures of revenue and human productivity. However, the business
value of IT goes beyond direct output or revenue measures because IT often supports organizational
redesign efforts.
•
Data managers decide whether they need IT systems for operational purposes or for strategic planning.
74
2 • Summary
Access for free at openstax.org

•
Managers see that IT can bring value through three primary methods, including automation of operation,
information generation for managing people and resources, and transformation of existing processes or
combined tasks.
•
Functional area information systems (FAIS) are designed to enhance the internal efficiency and
effectiveness of each department in an organization by providing valuable support tailored to each
respective department’s functions.
•
Business-IT alignment, or strategic alignment, refers to the strong integration of the IT function with an
organization’s strategy, mission, and objectives.
•
Gaps between business and IT departments can usually be attributed to different objectives, lack of
expertise awareness, and lack of communication.
•
To improve business-IT alignment, organizations should prioritize organizational communication, focus on
strengthening their governance, align scope and IT architecture, and emphasize the development of
human skills.
•
The five key strategies usually pursued by organizations when seeking to generate value include IT cost
leadership strategy, differentiation strategy, focus/innovation strategy, operational effectiveness strategy,
and customer-oriented strategy.
2.3 Digital Business Models
•
Organizations need to develop digital business models that deliver value to customers or users by
working as the vital connector between technology and the strategic goals of an organization.
•
A successful business model provides a logical framework that unlocks the hidden value of technologies,
allowing businesses to benefit economically, as well as serving as a blueprint for how a company
generates and captures value from new products, services, or innovations.
•
Common digital business models include e-commerce, subscription, freemium, affiliate, marketplace,
advertising, crowdfunding, sharing economy, and digital product.
•
Digital business models face criticisms and challenges including unequal distribution of opportunities,
level of control in algorithmic systems, and lack of transparency.
2.4 Business Process Management
•
The business process relies on three essential components: inputs, resources, and outputs.
•
Efficient and well-designed business processes are crucial for gaining a competitive advantage and
ensuring organizational success. Functional areas in the business process include accounting, finance,
marketing, production/operations, human resources, and management.
•
Measures of excellence when evaluating the execution of a business process include user satisfaction,
innovation, flexibility and adaptability, cost reduction, quality, differentiation, customer satisfaction,
environmental impact, and compliance and governance.
•
Key parameters in BPM that contribute to the successful digitalization of business process initiatives
within an organization include strategic alignment, methods, and culture.
•
By capturing and managing data, monitoring performance, and facilitating communication, information
systems contribute to improved efficiency, better decision-making, and overall business growth for any
business process.
2.5 Digital Innovation Creation, Distribution, and Commercialization
•
In management information systems, IT innovation focuses on the integration of new IT-enabled business
processes, products, and services within an organization, while digital innovation centers on the creation
of new offerings through the combination of physical and digital products and examines IT's role in
facilitating or constraining innovation.
•
The steps involved in digital innovation are initiation, development, implementation, and exploitation,
which are informed by the external competitive environment and the internal organizational environment.
Not all of these components are mandatory in every digital innovation effort, and they need not follow a
2 • Summary
75

prescribed order.
•
Digital platform strategies include opening the door to third parties, which creates an ecosystem for
external developers to integrate their products/services, enhancing platform functionality; connecting
customers, which facilitates interactions and transactions between customers, forming a marketplace; and
connecting products to connect customers, which links various products/services to provide a
comprehensive, seamless customer experience.
