Introduction
Many of us turn a key in our door lock or press a button on our car’s key fob as a routine habit. It’s quite easy
to lock up our living space or keep our vehicle secure. But how do we keep information secure? How can we
protect data the way we protect more tangible items around us? In today’s digital environment, most of our
interactions, transactions, and online engagement create a footprint of data that can be cataloged, tracked,
and used for a wide array of purposes. While data can help enterprises tailor personalized experiences for
customers or make insightful business decisions, it also brings to the forefront important considerations about
data protection, data integrity, and responsible computing. The issues of security, privacy, and risk in
information systems are of increasing importance in our modern digital landscape.

The state in which data are kept from unauthorized access through the proper handling, processing, storage,
and usage of data regarding consent, notice, and regulatory obligations is called data privacy. Its primary
focus consists of individuals’ rights to reasonable protection of their personal information from unauthorized
access, disclosure, or abuse. Additionally, data security is an element of data privacy and involves the
implementation of measures to ensure data are kept safe from corruption and unauthorized access while
preserving confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA).1
Data privacy and security are critical to any enterprise for several reasons, including trust and reputation,
prevention of financial loss, mitigation of financial risks, and controlled operational risks. Trust in this sense
refers to the confidence that consumers have in relation to an organization, while reputation is the collective
perception or evaluation of an organization.
Several data protection and management tools have been developed to further bolster efforts to keep data
safe. They involve the assessment and mitigation of privacy risks, the implementation of privacy engineering,
and the design of products and services that inherently respect and protect the privacy of individuals. Any
breach can significantly damage an enterprise’s reputation and consumer trust.2 To this end, several
regulations, such as the European General Data Protection Regulation and the California Consumer Privacy
Act, require businesses to protect personal data under threat of penalties and other legal actions.
The Importance of Enterprise Digital Data Privacy and Data Security
Data privacy and security play a critical role in our ever-expanding digital world. As businesses, governments,
and other large enterprises transition to digital platforms, the amount of data created has exponentially
increased. Historically, small companies and large enterprises have sought to contain their trade secrets,
customer information, and intellectual property rights through training and other mitigating measures. In a
nondigital landscape, access to sensitive information was often controlled through physical security, which is
the protection of buildings, hardware, and assets. This included measures such as locked cabinets, secure
rooms, and need-to-know restrictions, where only those with explicit permission could access certain data.
Personnel were trained to handle information carefully, and physical controls were in place to ensure that
unauthorized individuals couldn’t gain access. However, as technology has advanced, more data are now being
stored electronically, transmitted via the internet, and accessed from the cloud. Thus data are now much more
susceptible to breaches, accidental disclosures,and exploitation by bad actors. A bad actor is a person or
entity who hacks or cracks into a computer or system with malicious intent. Data privacy involves ensuring the
responsible use of personal information throughout the data life cycle, and it underpins the fundamental
principles of ethical business practices. For example, a customer signs up for an online service, and their data
are collected, stored, and used for account setup and personalized recommendations. After the service is
canceled, the data are archived for compliance purposes and eventually deleted following retention policies.
It is no secret that unauthorized access to confidential data, often leading to the exposure of sensitive
information, called a data breach, occurs often. However, what is staggering is the sheer number of user
accounts that have been compromised as a result. For example, in April of 2024, billions of records from a
background check service known as National Public Data (NPD) were exposed, affecting hundreds of millions
of people. The exposed records contained sensitive items such as Social Security numbers, birth dates, and
mailing addresses.3
In 2024, a data breach involving AT&T compromised approximately 100 million customer records, exposing
sensitive personal information, including names, addresses, and Social Security numbers. This incident
highlighted vulnerabilities in data storage and the growing challenges of securing customer information

against increasingly sophisticated cyberattacks.
Another major breach in 2024 affected Change Healthcare, a service provider to UnitedHealth. A ransomware
attack disrupted health-care operations nationwide, affecting claims processing and payments for weeks. It
was revealed that sensitive medical data, such as diagnoses, test results, and treatments for a substantial
proportion of Americans, had been stolen. The financial and operational fallout from this attack underscored
the critical importance of cybersecurity in health care.
Information generation has not grown in a steady, linear fashion; rather, it has increased exponentially as
companies have leveraged digital assets to maintain growth amid competition. For example, in the late 1970s,
the internet was in its early stages of development. The World Wide Web became publicly available in 1991,
and at that point, the internet was primarily text-based with limited multimedia content. As shown in Figure
6.2, the internet is remarkably different today from its original iteration.
Figure 6.2 The World Wide Web has seen many improvements and expansions since its first development in 1979. (credit:

The volume of data has increased exponentially due to the digital evolution, with global internet traffic
growing from 100 GB per day in 1992 to 150.7 TB per second by 2022,4 driven by vast amounts of content
generated and shared across various platforms. These figures highlight the explosion of data generation and
consumption over the past few decades, an explosion that’s been driven by technological advancements and
the digitization of various aspects of life. The challenge today lies not only in managing the volume of this
data, but also in harnessing it effectively and ethically. In other words, it is a complex challenge that
underscores the importance of data privacy and security.

FUTURE TECHNOLOGY
The Future of Data Provenance
As entities continue to collect data from various devices, websites, and social media platforms, an important
issue has arisen concerning the proper handling, integrity, and usage of that data. One concept known as
data provenance has emerged as a potential solution to reduce the threats of data mishandling,
contamination, and leakage. Data provenance refers to the documentation of a dataset’s life cycle, which is
essential for ensuring data quality and adherence to laws, regulations, and policies governing the industry
or operation, or compliance. There are three pillars that comprise data provenance:
•
Source provenance: tracking the origins of data
•
Transformation provenance: documenting the changes and processes the data undergo
•
Usage provenance: details on how data are accessed and used
Data provenance ensures trust and transparency, aids in meeting compliance with legal requirements, and
facilitates data reuse and reproducibility.
Data privacy and security are no longer mere IT issues. Rather, they form an essential aspect of an enterprise’s
strategic planning. Today, businesses are expected to be stewards of the data they hold, protecting
information from breaches and ensuring its appropriate use. As a result, enterprises are investing significantly
in data security measures and privacy protocols to safeguard customer data (and thereby maintain trust) and
to comply with increasingly stringent regulations. Security breaches can result in massive financial and
reputational damage. Thus, the need for robust data privacy measures is critical.
Consider the cases of Solar Winds and MGM Resorts. Solar Winds is a company that develops software to
manage and control computer networks. It was targeted in 2020 in an attack that affected thousands of
organizations globally and highlighted how vulnerable even the most sophisticated, well-protected networks
are.5 ,6 In 2023, MGM Resorts in Las Vegas, Nevada, was one victim of a ransomware attack that caused
significant outages of systems such as door locks, key card readers, and other hotel amenities. The damage
from the attack cost MGM over $100 million in lost revenue and was executed through BlackCat operators who
used social engineering techniques to gain access to critical systems.7 These attacks underscore that data
privacy is integral to maintaining consumer trust and the smooth operation of critical infrastructure, and in
extreme cases could be a national security concern.
Finally, it is essential to acknowledge the international dimensions of data privacy. In an interconnected world
where enterprises often operate across borders, understanding the nuances in privacy regulations and
practices in different regions is key because the location of the source of the data takes precedence over the
customer’s citizenship location. Whether it’s the more consumer-centric privacy model of the EU’s General Data
Protection Regulation (GDPR), the sector-specific approach in the United States, or the diverse and evolving
landscape of data privacy regulations in Asia and Australia, businesses need to be equipped to navigate these
varying landscapes while upholding their commitment to data privacy and security.

Risks and Consequences of Unprotected Personal Data and Sensitive
Information
Unprotected personal data and sensitive information pose a variety of risks, with far-reaching consequences
that extend beyond the digital realm. Cyber threats such as data breaches and identity theft—which is the act
of stealing someone’s information and assuming their identity—represent some of the most immediate risks
of unprotected personal data. Sometimes bad actors may wait for months or years before exploiting the
breached data to prevent suspicion that the data have been breached.
In 2024, IBM’s annual Cost of a Data Breach report revealed that the global average cost of a data breach has
reached $4.88 million, marking a 10 percent increase from the previous year. This underscores the growing
financial impact of data breaches on organizations worldwide.8 Beyond the financial loss, a data breach can
also result in a severe loss of customer trust, tarnishing the organization’s reputation. This may take years to
rebuild and could lead to a long-term decrease in the company’s market value.
One of the most striking examples of this is the Equifax breach in 2017, which exposed the personal
information, including Social Security numbers, of nearly 147 million people. In its aftermath, the company
faced hundreds of millions of dollars in legal fees and reparations, and the value of its stock fell by more than
30 percent.9 As of 2024, Equifax has had to pay over $425 million to users affected by the breach and has
invested in over $1.6 billion to improve security and technology.10
Cyber Espionage
The use of online methods to obtain secret or confidential information without the permission of the holder of
the information, typically for strategic, military, or political advantage, is considered cyber espionage. The risk
of cyber espionage continues to escalate, with unprotected personal data often being the target. A notable
example from 2022 is the Uber data breach, where an attacker compromised the company’s internal systems.
This incident exposed a vast amount of sensitive data and disrupted Uber’s operations. The breach not only
raised concerns about the protection of user and employee data, but also highlighted vulnerabilities in
corporate cybersecurity practices. Additionally, the persistent threat of ransomware attacks remains a major
concern. These attacks, which involve hijacking an organization’s data for ransom, have seen a significant rise
in sophistication and frequency, further emphasizing the need for robust data security measures.
Reputational Harm
Unprotected personal data and sensitive information pose a significant risk to both businesses and
individuals. Data can be exploited for fraudulent activities, identity theft, and other malicious acts. But the
repercussions of inadequate data protection extend beyond immediate financial harm and can significantly
damage an organization’s reputation and erode customer trust. Trust is a critical element of customer loyalty
and a significant factor in a business’s success. When customers provide businesses with their personal data,
they are entrusting those businesses to keep their information safe. A data breach can lead to a breach of that
trust, which can be challenging to restore.
According to IBM’s report, the largest contributor to the costs associated with data was “lost business,” which
includes customer attrition, reputation damage, increased customer acquisition costs, and lost revenue
opportunities.11 One high-profile example of this is the 2013 Target data breach, which resulted in the theft of
the credit and debit card information of 40 million customers. This breach cost Target approximately $291
million and caused significant damage to its reputation. Their sales decreased dramatically in the last quarter
of 2013, and fewer households reported shopping at Target.12

6.1 • Key Concepts in Data Privacy and Data Security
215

The rise of privacy-conscious consumers, those who are aware of and concerned about how their personal
data are collected and distributed, means that businesses need to be even more diligent in their data
protection efforts. A 2020 Cisco report found that 84 percent of consumers care about data privacy, and 80
percent are willing to act to protect it—meaning they would switch away from companies that have poor data
practices or policies.13 Organizations must continue to invest significantly in data security measures and
privacy protocols to safeguard their customer’s data, maintain trust, and comply with increasingly stringent
regulations.
How Enterprise Security and Risk Policies Impact Data Privacy
Enterprise security and risk policies are fundamental in shaping an organization’s approach to data privacy. To
ensure the effectiveness of these policies, organizations often turn to established frameworks such as those
recommended by the Information Systems Audit and Control Association (ISACA), where white papers and
research articles offer valuable insights into best practices. The MIS Quarterly Executive (MISQE), Journal of
Management Information Systems (JMIS), Communications of the ACM (CACM), Journal of the Association for
Information Systems (JAIS), and Communications of the AIS (CAIS) serve as reputable sources of the latest
advancements in the science of privacy. While Privacy by Design and privacy engineering are closely related,
they focus on different, albeit complementary, goals. Privacy by Design aims to integrate privacy
considerations into the design and operation of IT systems, business practices, and networked infrastructure
right from the outset.
Privacy by Design and Privacy Engineering
To make these principles actionable, standards such as the ISO/IEC 27701 for privacy information
management, and frameworks such as Privacy by Design (PbD) by Ann Cavoukian14 are invaluable. Cavoukian
characterized this Privacy by Design approach as proactive more so than reactive; it anticipates privacy
invasion events before they occur. These tools allow businesses to convert abstract, principles-based legal
mandates into implementable technical privacy controls compatible with existing security measures. The
Privacy by Design model employs seven principles, such as being proactive and embedding privacy, into the
design (Figure 6.3). By adhering to such standards, organizations can mitigate risks and foster trust, which is
particularly vital in an age where data breaches and cyberattacks are increasingly sophisticated and damaging.

Considering all these threats, several national and international organizations, corporations, and governments
have taken measures to promote data protection and integrity. Through features such as app tracking
transparency and clear privacy labels on the App Store, Apple provides users with greater visibility and control
over how their data are used, although the overall architecture of their system remains relatively closed
compared with more open platforms.
Data scientists suggest that data are providing an endless stream of new digital capital. However,
organizations that fail to take data privacy and security seriously may lose their competitive edge as well as
customer trust, and/or face regulatory action. Tackling the massive scale and complexity of data management
requires the implementation of robust, risk-based frameworks.
An emerging field in this context is privacy engineering, which is fundamentally about incorporating privacy
principles directly into the design and development of IT systems, networks, and business practices. By
making privacy an integral part of the design and development process rather than an afterthought,
enterprises can effectively mitigate risks and better protect user data. Some examples of privacy engineering
include:
•
Google’s Differential Privacy: This practice allows Google to leverage the ability to learn from aggregate
data while ensuring that returned search results and map addresses do not permit anyone to learn about
a particular individual. Google has used this with Google Maps to help show the busy times at restaurants
and other locations without divulging the location history data of users.
•
Apple’s Privacy Labels: Apple has developed Privacy Labels for its App Store. These labels provide simple,
straightforward summaries of an app’s privacy practices, and they are written in plain language, letting
consumers know what data an app collects and whether the data are linked to them or used to track
them.
•
Microsoft’s Data Loss Prevention (DLP): Microsoft developed a data loss prevention solution to prevent
sensitive information from leaking out of the organization. This solution identifies sensitive information
across several platforms, such as Exchange Online, SharePoint, OneDrive for Business, and Microsoft
Teams. This measure ensures that data are not inadvertently shared with the wrong groups. While DLP
does well with implementing controls that prevent data loss, it does not focus on physical security.
On the other hand, privacy engineering refers to the technical and operational aspects of implementing
privacy principles in systems and services. Its goal is to operationalize the concepts of Privacy by Design
through specific methodologies, tools, and technologies. Privacy engineering focuses on developing practical
solutions and practices that protect individuals’ privacy and meet regulatory requirements. This includes
6.1 • Key Concepts in Data Privacy and Data Security
217

creating data protection features, ensuring secure data processing, and developing privacy-preserving
technologies. While Privacy by Design sets the framework and objectives for privacy, privacy engineering
focuses on actual implementation of those objectives in the real world. Like Privacy by Design, privacy
engineering focuses more on the technical aspects of implementing data protection controls. One example of
a social media company that uses this idea is Snapchat, which limits the amount of time a message can be
viewed once it is sent.
CAREERS IN IS
Data Privacy and Security Career Options
With its ever-evolving challenges and emerging practices, the area of data privacy and security offers many
exciting opportunities. Those seeking to work in this field may consider these roles, for example:
•
Privacy analyst/privacy consultant: A specialist who assesses and advises organizations on complying
with data protection laws and regulations. They analyze privacy policies, conduct privacy impact
assessments, and recommend strategies to protect personal data.
•
Chief privacy officer (CPO): A high-level executive responsible for an organization’s data privacy policies
and procedures. The CPO ensures compliance with privacy laws, oversees data protection strategies,
and manages privacy risks.
•
Cybersecurity analyst: A professional who focuses on protecting an organization’s computer systems
and networks. They monitor breaches, investigate security incidents, and implement security measures
to safeguard sensitive data.
•
Information security manager: A role responsible for overseeing and managing an organization’s
information security program. They develop and implement policies and procedures to protect data
from unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction.
•
Compliance officer: A role that involves ensuring an organization meets external regulatory
requirements and internal policies, especially concerning data protection and privacy laws.
•
Data protection lawyer: A legal professional specializing in data protection and privacy law. They advise
clients on compliance with data protection regulations, represent in case of data breaches, and help
draft privacy policies.
Third-Party Risks
A key aspect of security and risk policies is the management of third-party risks, including third-party access,
which is access to data from an external entity. In an interconnected digital ecosystem, organizations often
share data with partners, vendors, and other third parties. This is particularly significant given the rise of cloud
computing, which is the delivery of computing services over the internet, and Software as a Service (SaaS),
which is a software distribution model in which applications are hosted by a third-party provider and made
available to customers over the internet, typically on a subscription basis. For instance, Amazon Web Services,
Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure handle vast amounts of data from countless businesses. These enterprises
must ensure that their security policies cover these relationships and that third parties meet stringent security
standards.
The measures that enterprises can adopt include regular audits and inspections, solid contractual agreements
regarding data handling, and clear communication about responsibilities in the event of a security breach.
Furthermore, an enterprise’s data might be shared with a third party not only for storage purposes, but also
for processing. Many businesses employ third-party data analytics firms to make the most of their collected
information.

FUTURE TECHNOLOGY
Two Privacy Developments on the Horizon
The future of technology in information systems paints a promising picture for data privacy and protection.
Here’s a brief look at two key developments:
•
Federated learning: An emerging concept in machine learning, federated learning allows a model to be
trained across multiple decentralized devices or servers holding local data samples, without
exchanging the data samples themselves. This helps to maintain privacy as raw data never leave their
original device.15
•
Homomorphic encryption: A form of encryption allowing computations to be carried out on encrypted
data, homomorphic encryption produces an encrypted result that, when decrypted, matches the result
of operations performed on the plain data. This means sensitive data can be processed securely in
encrypted form, without ever needing to be decrypted, thereby maintaining data privacy.16
These technologies demonstrate how the future of information systems may uphold robust data protection
while still leveraging the benefits of data-driven insights. As these technologies mature, they will play an
increasingly significant role in securing information systems and ensuring data privacy.
For stakeholders such as investors and partners, solid security policies imply the organization’s proactive
stance toward risk management, which can increase their confidence in the organization’s resilience against
potential data breaches. The best policies will be those that keep evolving with the changing technology
landscape and regulatory environment, continuously fostering a culture of privacy and accountability in the
organization. In accountability, people and entities must take responsibility for the decisions they make and
be able to explain them.
Data Privacy Regulations and Standards
Data privacy regulations and standards have become increasingly important in today’s data-driven world. With
vast quantities of personal data being collected and processed daily, these regulations ensure the
safeguarding of personal information and provide a standardized approach for businesses to manage data
privacy. Across the globe, nations are developing regulations to address this ever-evolving need. For example,
the Personal Data Protection Act (PDPA) in Singapore strives to protect personal data across the economy by
serving as a complement to sector-specific legislative and regulatory frameworks.17 Meanwhile, in Brazil, the
Lei Geral de Proteção de Dados (LGPD) came into effect in August 2020, aligning the country more closely with
the global trend toward stricter data privacy regulations.18 The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
is a comprehensive data protection law in the European Union that sets guidelines for the collection and
processing of personal information of individuals within the EU.19 The GDPR represents a major shift in data
privacy regulations. It has introduced several significant changes, including stricter requirements for consent,
which is the explicit permission given by an individual for the collection, processing, and use of their personal
information. Additionally, the GDPR expanded data subject rights (such as the right to be forgotten, the right
to data portability, and the right to object to processing), and steeper penalties for noncompliance, up to 4
percent of an organization’s global annual turnover or 20 million euros, whichever is higher.20

219

In a similar manner, the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), a law that increases privacy rights and
consumer protection for residents of California, has set a benchmark for data privacy in the United States21
(Table 6.1). While it only applies to businesses that meet certain criteria (such as having gross annual revenues
over $25 million), the CCPA is influencing data practices beyond California. It is likely to inspire similar
legislation in other states, or potentially at the federal level.22 Under the CCPA, businesses must disclose what
data they collect, sell, or share, and consumers can opt out of the sale of their data, request deletion of their
data, or access the data that businesses have collected about them.

Table 6.1 Comparison of the CCPR and GDPR The U.S.’s California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) and the E.U.’s General Data
Protection Regulation (GDPR) are two regional regulations that provide foundational frameworks for cybersecurity.
However, it’s not just regulatory compliance that organizations need to consider. Industry standards also play a
crucial role in shaping how businesses protect personal data. For instance, the International Organization for
Standardization (ISO) has introduced ISO/IEC 27701, an extension to ISO/IEC 27001, the international standard
for information security management systems. ISO/IEC 27701 provides guidance on how to manage privacy
information, essentially translating privacy principles from regulations like the GDPR into actionable controls.
This involves not only technical measures, but also administrative ones, such as defining roles and
responsibilities, maintaining records of processing activities, and ensuring proper data breach response
procedures.23 By adopting ISO/IEC 27701, organizations can demonstrate their commitment to privacy,
reassure customers and stakeholders, and potentially gain a competitive advantage.
Businesses will also need to consider other relevant regulations in their respective jurisdictions. For instance,
in Canada, businesses must comply with the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act

legislation and industry standards. Companies will need to stay vigilant and adaptive, not just to avoid
penalties, but also to earn and maintain their customers’ trust and loyalty. This is particularly true in an era
where data privacy is increasingly seen as a differentiator and a competitive advantage. Trust in how
businesses handle personal data can significantly impact their brand reputation, customer relationships, and,
ultimately, their bottom line.
The landscape of data privacy is becoming increasingly complex, and staying abreast of these regulations and
standards is crucial for businesses.

Every connected device you own is collecting data—about your preferences, routines, and even your health.
This data, if compromised, can lead to significant privacy breaches. As we become increasingly reliant on IoT
technology, it is essential to recognize the risks that come with it. The concern is not just about securing your
smartphone or computer. It is about securing a network of devices that know more about you than you might
realize.
The solution rests in understanding the inherent vulnerabilities of web applications and IoT technology and
recognizing the potential threats that exploit these weaknesses. In our age of extensive data collection and
usage, commitment to transparency, accountability, and privacy protection becomes a cornerstone of
responsible innovation. Examining these issues requires exploring privacy and security risks associated with
the web and IoT technology, potential countermeasures, ethical considerations, and prospective regulatory
frameworks.
Common Online Vulnerabilities and Threats
In the span of a few decades, digital technology has transformed the world. The arrival of the mobile
revolution introduced an era of smartphones, bringing the internet from the confines of home and office
spaces into the palms of our hands. The digital revolution continued with the equipping of even the simplest
items with internet connectivity, forming the core of the modern digital era.
The Internet of Things (IoT), a term coined by Kevin Ashton in 1999, is the network that connects everyday
physical objects to the internet, enabling them to collect and share data with other devices or systems. The IoT
now encapsulates a vast array of everyday items from refrigerators and thermostats to door locks and light
bulbs, converting them into smart, connected devices (Figure 6.4). The sheer scale of IoT’s growth is nothing
short of astounding. To put it in perspective, in 2003, the number of devices connected to the internet was
estimated at around 500 million.24 By 2018, that number had increased to 10 billion.25 And the number of IoT
devices in use globally is expected to reach 40 billion by 2030.26

This rapid expansion of the IoT has significant implications, both positive and negative. On one hand, it creates
new opportunities for innovation, efficiency, and convenience as smart homes equipped with IoT devices can
automate a variety of tasks, from adjusting the thermostat to managing home security systems. However, the
proliferation of IoT devices also introduces substantial security vulnerabilities both at home and at work. The
introduction of these devices into the workplace further complicates security for IT managers because
vulnerabilities in IoT devices often allow attackers to eavesdrop, conduct brute-force attacks, and elevate their
privileges on a network.
Keeping pace with the rapid advancement in IoT technologies and adequately addressing the myriad security
risks they present is a significant challenge for regulatory bodies. The sheer number of IoT devices and the
rapid growth of that number, plus their widespread distribution, further complicate regulation. These devices,
often manufactured in one region, sold in another, and potentially operated in a third, create a transnational
landscape that can blur jurisdictional lines and make enforcement of regulations challenging. Additionally, the
proprietary nature of many IoT devices poses its own set of problems. In many instances, device
manufacturers prioritize time to market and functionality over security, leading to devices with hard-to-patch
vulnerabilities. Some manufacturers might use proprietary protocols, which are tools specific to the
organization and closed off to the public, making it difficult for regulatory bodies to assess and ensure their
security.
The high-profile Mirai botnet attack of 2016 serves as an important real-world example of these challenges.
This was a distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack that exploited many inherent weaknesses in IoT security:
default passwords, unsecured network services, and the lack of regular software updates in many devices. The
attack targeted and overwhelmed the servers of Dyn, a major DNS provider, with a tremendous amount of
traffic. This disruption impacted several high-profile platforms and services, including Twitter, Netflix, Reddit,
and CNN, rendering them inaccessible to millions of users for several hours. This incident showcased how
easily IoT devices can be exploited for malicious purposes and the far-reaching consequences of such security
lapses.
Similarly, IoT technology is transforming industry practices. Industry 4.0, which represents the fourth industrial
revolution noted by the integration of digital technology in manufacturing and digital practices, allows for real-
time monitoring, predictive maintenance, and increased operational efficiency. However, these devices also
present a potential entry point for cyberattacks, risking not only data breaches, but also physical damage and

potential safety hazards.
Given the expansive growth and diverse applications of IoT technologies, one thing is clear, while IoT devices
bring a multitude of benefits, they also carry significant risks. As we continue to incorporate these
technologies into various facets of life, it is important to understand and mitigate these vulnerabilities.
Web Applications: Banking and E-commerce
Among the most prevalent and potentially damaging threats in the digital realm are those targeting web
applications, particularly in sectors like banking and e-commerce. A study by the security firm Positive
Technologies found that 100 percent of web applications contain at least one security vulnerability, with 48
percent of these vulnerabilities considered high risk.27 Online banking systems are prime targets for
cybercriminals due to the sensitive nature of the information they handle.
Techniques like phishing—wherein users are tricked into providing their login credentials to fake
websites—and SQL injection—where hackers exploit a vulnerability in a web application’s database query
software—can result in unauthorized account access and monetary loss. Similarly, e-commerce platforms face
threats such as credit card fraud, DDoS attacks, and cross-site scripting (XSS), which is a type of vulnerability
that allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into websites trusted by end users, leading to potential theft
of sensitive data such as login credentials or credit card information.
IoT Technology: Smart Homes and Self-Driving Cars
IoT technology has transformed sectors such as home automation and transportation, and as more devices
become connected to the internet, the potential for vulnerabilities increases. Smart homes, with internet-
connected security systems, thermostats, and appliances, are particularly susceptible to threats such as device
hijacking, where attackers gain control over IoT devices. Similarly, self-driving cars, which rely on complex
systems and sensors, face significant cybersecurity risks, as many of their systems were not originally
designed with security in mind. In 2024, a high-profile incident occurred when researchers demonstrated the
ability to remotely hack into the infotainment system of a Tesla, gaining access to critical vehicle functions.
ETHICS IN IS
German Steel Mill Attacks
ThyssenKrupp, a major German steel producer, was targeted by a sophisticated cyberattack in early 2024.
The attack disrupted the operations of its automotive division, forcing parts of the facility offline to contain
the threat. Although full details have not been disclosed, the attack demonstrated the ongoing vulnerability
of industrial control systems (ICS) in the manufacturing sector. The incident involved cybercriminals gaining
unauthorized access to critical systems. Another attack on a German steel mill ten years prior used spear-
phishing tactics to infiltrate the office network before accessing the plant’s production networks. Attackers
manipulated control systems, causing significant physical damage, including a blast furnace that could not
be properly shut down. This event marked a pivotal moment in understanding the real-world dangers of
cyberattacks on industrial systems.
Both incidents highlight the increased risks associated with the convergence of operational technology (OT)
and information technology (IT) networks. This integration, a hallmark of the Industrial Internet of Things
(IIoT), has expanded the attack surface, making industrial facilities more susceptible to cyber threats. The
ThyssenKrupp attack serves as a stark reminder that even with advancements in cybersecurity, industrial
control systems remain vulnerable to sophisticated cyber threats, with the potential for substantial physical
damage.

Frameworks to Identify Vulnerabilities and Protect IoT/IT Ecosystems
The IoT ecosystem, marked by its complexity and breadth of use cases, presents its own set of regulatory
challenges. Unlike more traditional, monolithic systems, IoT is characterized by a multitude of interconnected
devices, platforms, and services, spanning across various sectors and geographical boundaries. One example
would be a “smart” refrigerator communicating with a smartphone to replenish grocery items by adding them
to the grocery shopping list for home delivery and communicating this information to the grocery store
identified by the homeowner.
This variety of devices and tasks not only introduces numerous potential vulnerabilities but also makes it
difficult to apply a one-size-fits-all regulatory framework. One of the primary regulatory challenges in IoT is its
vast and rapidly evolving nature. IoT devices range from simple sensors to complex industrial systems, each
with different security requirements and implications.
As such, it is necessary to examine the existing structure of rules and guidelines, often legislated, within which
an industry or business must operate, or the regulatory framework.
Organizations such as the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), International Electrotechnical
Commission (IEC), and the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) have developed standards,
such as ISO/IEC 27001 and IEEE 2413, to address these vulnerabilities through risk management frameworks
and architectural guidelines. The ISO/IEC 27001 provides the framework for an information security
management system (ISMS), which is a systematic approach consisting of processes and procedures designed
to control an organization’s information security risks. An ISMS allows organizations to manage security in a
comprehensive and structured manner, ensuring that all potential vulnerabilities are addressed and that
systems are resilient to potential attacks. The IEEE has been heavily involved in developing standards for IoT.
One such standard is the IEEE 2413, an architectural framework for IoT that aims to promote cross-domain
interaction, aid system interoperability and functional compatibility, and foster a common understanding
among IoT systems.
International standards offer guidelines that help ensure the robustness, security, and interoperability of web
and IoT technologies. They also provide a basis for creating regulations and laws that can govern these
technologies in different regions worldwide. Cities adopting smart technologies often rely on these
international standards to ensure the reliable and secure operation of their systems. For instance, another
standard from the ISO, ISO/IEC 30141, provides a reference architecture for IoT, assisting the developers and
operators of smart city solutions in creating systems that can securely communicate and interact.
However, since current regulations such as GDPR and CCPA are region-specific, there is a need for more
comprehensive global regulations. Countries such as the United Kingdom, Brazil, and India are developing
specific IoT security laws, reflecting a trend toward targeted regulatory measures. For example, Brazil’s Lei
Geral de Proteção de Dados (LGPD) and India’s Personal Data Protection Bill reflect global concerns regarding
data privacy. Countries such as the United Kingdom have initiated specific guidelines for IoT device security,
focusing on secure passwords and regular updates. New regulatory trends such as these require different
stakeholders to adapt. Businesses must understand and comply with various international regulations, making
it necessary to invest in legal expertise. Consumers benefit from these protections, and as a result, they
develop confidence in digital services.
Regulators face challenges, however, in balancing consumer protection with enabling technological
innovation. Future challenges may arise from the integration of IoT with 5G networks, quantum computing,
and decentralized technologies such as blockchain. These advancements will necessitate a reevaluation of
existing regulations and potentially lead to new regulatory frameworks. Strategies may include international
collaboration to standardize regulations across jurisdictions, fostering innovation while maintaining security.
For example, the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Cross-Border Privacy Rules (CBPR) is a system
privacy framework designed to facilitate the secure flow of personal information across APEC borders while
224

maintaining strong privacy protections.
Industry-led self-regulation extends beyond established examples such as Payment Card Industry Data
Security Standard (PCI DSS), which is a set of standards designed to ensure companies secure credit
information. For example, the Center for Internet Security (CIS), a nonprofit organization that works to
safeguard private and public organizations against cyber threats, provides guidelines that organizations can
voluntarily follow. The Industrial Internet Consortium (IIC)—which is an organization that accelerates the
growth of the industrial internet by promoting best practices, reference architectures, and frameworks—has
released a security framework to guide industries in building secure IoT systems.
In addition, the Internet of Things Security Foundation (IoTSF) provides a comprehensive set of guidelines and
best practices for securing IoT devices. The continually evolving landscape of IoT and web regulations,
combined with the increasing role of self-regulation by the industry, emphasizes the importance of
understanding various global regulations and guidelines. These include well-known examples such as GDPR
and CCPA, plus emerging trends such as LGPD, IIC, and IoTSF. Adapting to these changes requires ongoing
vigilance, collaboration, and commitment to balancing innovation with ethical principles and consumer
protection.

Countermeasures to Combat Online Security Threats
With an ever-increasing reliance on interconnected digital technologies, security risks continue to escalate.
Cybersecurity incidents have the potential to cause not only digital disruption, but also substantial real-world
impacts. There is an array of strategies designed to manage the risks associated with these technologies, from
preventive measures such as secure coding and data encryption to reactive solutions such as incident
response plans. These countermeasures help professionals better navigate the challenges of technological
advancement and safeguard digital environments.
6.2 • Vulnerabilities and Threats in Web Applications and IoT Technology
225

Implementing Secure Coding Practices
Securing web applications begins with secure coding practices. Because code is one of the key elements of a
digital system, poor coding practices can inadvertently introduce vulnerabilities that bad actors can exploit to
compromise these systems and cause data breaches or service disruptions. One notable example of a data
breach that took advantage of coding errors is that of First American Financial Corporation, a leading provider
of title insurance and settlement services to the real estate and mortgage industries. In 2019, hundreds of
millions of documents related to mortgage deals going back to 2003 were leaked due to a coding issue that
permitted attackers to access unauthorized information by manipulating the URL of the website. 28
These practices encompass various activities such as validating input, ensuring proper error handling, and
maintaining the principle of least privilege. Following guidelines such as the OWASP Secure Coding Practices
can help developers avoid common pitfalls that lead to vulnerabilities in the code. Secure coding practices
include the following:
•
Systems should always check inputs received from users or from other systems for their data type, length,
format, and range, a process called input validation. Any input that does not meet these requirements
should be rejected.
•
Every module or process should follow the least privilege principle, in which users are granted the
minimum levels of access, or permissions, needed to perform their job functions, reducing the risk of
unauthorized access to sensitive information. If a function only needs to read from a file, it should not
have write access to the file. This reduces the potential damage that can be done if the function is
compromised. If a malicious actor gains control of a process, they are restricted by the permissions of that
process. For example, if a database query only needs to retrieve data, it should not have permission to
alter or delete the data.
•
Implement strategies and coding practices to effectively identify, report, and manage errors that occur
during the operation of a software application or system. Potential errors need to be systematically
managed and addressed to prevent system failures and security breaches, known as error handling.
Strengthening Authentication and Authorization
The importance of robust authentication and authorization mechanisms in web applications cannot be
overstated. In such applications, user credentials typically serve as the keys to unlocking a massive amount of
sensitive information and services. Hence, their protection helps maintain the integrity and confidentiality of
these resources as well as user trust.
Multifactor authentication (MFA), biometric identification, and risk-based authentication are among the
strategies that can significantly bolster the authentication and authorization process. MFA, which requires the
user to provide two or more verification factors, adds an extra layer of security, making it harder for attackers
to gain access even if they compromise one factor. Biometric identification, such as fingerprints or facial
recognition, provides a unique verification method that is difficult to replicate, thereby enhancing security.
Risk-based authentication adjusts the authentication process based on the risk level associated with the user’s
behavior or access conditions. Such an approach allows for a balance between security and usability, offering a
more robust protection mechanism when needed.
Designing for Security and Hardware Measures
As you learned in Chapter 5 Information Systems Security Risk Management, technologies such as intrusion
detection systems (IDSs) and intrusion prevention systems (IPSs) play a vital role. These systems identify
possible threats and deploy measures to mitigate them.
A predominant concern in IoT is the integral need for security starting from the very roots. For example
commonplace items such as home appliances, vehicles, and personal devices have become embedded with

Maintaining security of IoT devices involves regular firmware updates. These updates play a dual role: first,
they bring new features and rectify bugs, and second, they patch security vulnerabilities, which is key to
preserving the security of the device throughout its life cycle. Further critical to IoT security is secure device
onboarding, which involves adding devices to the network in a secure manner that prevents unauthorized
access and protects the integrity of the network.
Social Responsibility of Enterprises and Information Technology
Professionals
Technology has permeated virtually every aspect of modern life, largely propelled by the proliferation of IoT
and web applications. This pervasive integration of IoT has brought to the forefront a range of ethical
considerations that were once limited to more clearly defined technological areas. It now encompasses not
only privacy and data security, but wider societal issues such as accessibility, inclusivity, environmental
sustainability, and professional ethics. This evolution underscores the critical need for a comprehensive
understanding and proactive management of ethical concerns in all areas of technology.
Ethical Considerations in Information Technology
Data handling and management, professional responsibilities, and promoting digital inclusivity are critical
ethical considerations in the field of IT. Key aspects of these principles include:
•
Data collection, storage, processing, and sharing:
◦
Collecting: Enterprises must be transparent about the nature and purpose of data collection, ensuring
users are fully informed.
◦
Storing and processing: Robust security measures are necessary to prevent unauthorized access and
potential misuse, safeguarding sensitive information.
◦
Sharing: Data sharing practices should prioritize user privacy and adhere to relevant regulations,
ensuring that information is treated with respect.
•
Professional responsibilities of IT professionals:
◦
Protecting user data and ensuring privacy
◦
Promoting accessibility and reducing the digital divide
◦
Upholding fairness and inclusivity within the digital realm
•
Adherence to professional codes of ethics:
6.2 • Vulnerabilities and Threats in Web Applications and IoT Technology
227

◦
Complying with codes of ethics from organizations such as the Association of Computing Machinery
(ACM) and IEEE that guide IT professionals in ethical decision-making
◦
Operating under key principles such as respecting privacy, avoiding harm, performing with honesty and
trustworthiness, and contributing to society and human well-being
•
Digital inclusivity and accessibility:
◦
Ensuring equal access to technology, regardless of socioeconomic background, geographical location,
or physical abilities
◦
Designing technology with accessibility in mind benefits diverse user needs, improving both reach and
user experience

Point: Some scholars assert that technology companies have an inherent moral duty to prioritize human
well-being in their operations, citing ethical theories such as utilitarianism (https://openstax.org/r/
109Utilitarian) and corporate social responsibility.
Counterpoint: Others argue that the primary responsibility of these enterprises is to their shareholders
(https://openstax.org/r/109Shareholders) and that ethical considerations, while important, should not
overshadow business objectives.
Role of Enterprises in Promoting Digital Inclusivity and Accessibility
Ensuring everyone has equal access to technological advances is an important social issue. Digital inclusivity,
which entails making IT solutions available and accessible to all, has a profound impact on narrowing the
digital divide. The digital divide refers to the gap between individuals, communities, or countries that have
access to modern information and communication technologies and those that do not. This divide can
manifest in various forms, such as differences in internet access, digital literacy, and the availability of
affordable devices and services. Tech enterprises have the responsibility to foster an inclusive digital
environment. By developing affordable and accessible technologies, they can ensure that the benefits of
digital innovation reach all corners of society and that users can effectively utilize these solutions.
This necessitates designing technology with diverse user needs in mind. From building websites that are
accessible to individuals with visual or hearing impairments, to creating software that is easy to navigate for
individuals with cognitive or motor skill challenges, the commitment to accessibility is a cornerstone of ethical
IT development. Designing with accessibility in mind not only widens the user base, but also enhances the
overall user experience.
ETHICS IN IS
Ethical Decision-Making in IT
To illustrate the importance of ethical decision-making, consider the case of a social media platform
deciding to implement a new data-sharing policy. Adherence to ethical principles would mean that the
platform informs its users about the policy changes in a clear and transparent manner, allows users to opt
out if they desire, and implements robust measures to protect shared data. In contrast, an unethical
228
6 • Enterprise Security, Data Privacy, and Risk Management
Access for free at openstax.org

approach would be to implement the policy covertly without informing users or obtaining their consent. A
real-world example of not following ethical principles was demonstrated by Facebook in 2014.
Facebook faced significant controversy when it was revealed that the company had covertly conducted a
psychological experiment on nearly 700,000 unsuspecting users. The experiment, carried out in 2012,
involved manipulating users’ news feeds to either reduce the number of positive posts or reduce the
number of negative posts they saw. The objective was to determine whether the changes could sway users’
emotions and influence their subsequent posts. The results suggested that emotional states could be
transmitted across the social network, leading to a ripple effect.
However, the study’s execution sparked significant backlash. Critics argued that Facebook had manipulated
users’ emotions without their explicit consent, raising serious ethical concerns regarding user consent and
the boundaries of corporate research. The incident served as a stark reminder of the need for clearer
guidelines and transparency when conducting research on platforms with such extensive user bases. This
conversation about ethics and transparency was further highlighted in U.S. Senate Committee on the
Judiciary’s congressional hearings during 2024 when lawmakers scrutinized the impact of social media on
teens’ mental health and the ethical responsibilities of tech companies.
Transparency and Accountability
Transparency has become a significant ethical issue in IT. In the context of organizations and governance,
transparency refers to openness, communication, and accountability, where actions and decisions are clear
and understandable to stakeholders. Users have the right to know how their data are collected, stored, used,
and shared. Enterprises need to be transparent in their data practices, providing clear and understandable
privacy policies and consent mechanisms. Transparent practices not only meet regulatory requirements, but
also foster trust between users and enterprises, which is crucial for long-term user engagement.
The roles of tech enterprises and IT professionals in being accountable for the social and ethical implications
of technology have never been more critical. Both entities are key stakeholders in shaping the norms and
values of the digital realm. Enterprises must imbue their business strategies with ethical considerations, from
protecting user data to ensuring digital inclusivity. Likewise, IT professionals, the frontline workers of the
digital revolution, must adhere to professional ethical codes, conscientiously delivering solutions that honor
user rights and societal values. It is through their collective efforts that technology can truly serve its purpose
as a tool for advancing societal well-being.
Social Responsibility in the Information Technology Sector
The obligation of companies to act in ways that benefit society and the environment beyond what is legally
required is considered social responsibility. In the IT sector, social responsibility is expected to evolve and
deepen as emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence, IoT, and blockchain raise new ethical questions
that will require innovative and thoughtful responses. As these technologies become increasingly integrated
into everyday life, the ethical dimensions of IT will extend beyond individual user rights to encompass broader
societal impacts, including sustainability. The future will call for an even stronger commitment from
enterprises and IT professionals to uphold ethical standards, promote transparency, ensure digital inclusivity,
and champion sustainability.

By the end of this section, you will be able to:
•
Identify global frameworks in data security and privacy
•
Identify global regulations and requirements for data security and privacy
•
Apply a framework to a case study
In an era driven by digitization and the Internet of Things (IoT), vast amounts of data are generated, collected,
processed, and transmitted daily. From personal user preferences in online shopping to critical health data,
information flows through global networks with an ease previously unimaginable. Data have indeed become
one of the most valuable commodities in the modern era, both for businesses and for bad actors, making the
frameworks that guide its safekeeping vitally important to maintaining the integrity of our digital future.
Reflecting the diverse concerns of different regions and industries, several frameworks have emerged that
now serve as a universal staple in data management practices of multiple private, public, and governmental
organizations. These frameworks, such as the COBIT 2019, the Enterprise Privacy Risk Management
Framework, and the ISO/IEC 27701, provide structured practices that enable enterprises to comply with
regulatory demands and establish and maintain a culture of data integrity and privacy-centric operations.
These international standards are critical as they shield enterprises from potential breaches and legal
repercussions in the respective country.
However, the world of data security and privacy is in a perpetual state of evolution. The introduction of
landmark regulations such as the European Union’s GDPR or California’s CCPA is testament to the shifting
sands of data governance, with each new regulation aiming to balance business innovation with individual
rights. In navigating this dynamic terrain, organizations must not only be aware of these frameworks and
regulations, but also thoroughly understand their nuances and the underlying principles they champion.
Global Frameworks in Data Security and Privacy
Due to the explosive growth and constant evolution of technologies frameworks have been established
through the collaboration of international standards organizations, governmental bodies, and industry groups
to establish guidelines that resonate on a worldwide scale. Some of the most well-known are the globally
recognized COBIT 2019 Framework, the Enterprise Privacy Risk Management Framework, ISO/IEC 27701, and
the NIST Privacy Framework.
COBIT 2019 Framework
Developed by the Information Systems Audit and Control Association (ISACA), Control Objectives for
Information and Related Technologies (COBIT) stands out as a comprehensive framework designed for the
governance and management of enterprise IT. While its primary focus is IT governance, its principles and
guidelines offer a holistic approach to robust data protection. The framework, previously known as COBIT5 and
then overhauled in 2019, emphasizes the importance of stakeholder needs, risk management, and a value-
based, holistic approach that aligns IT goals with business objectives. Organizations employing this framework
may use it to:
•
establish a systematic approach to managing personal data
•
ensure that privacy risks are identified and mitigated
•
demonstrate compliance with privacy regulations globally
•
foster trust among stakeholders, especially data subjects, by showcasing a commitment to privacy
An example of COBIT adoption is the European Network of Transmission System Operators for Electricity
(ENTSO-E).

Tasked with representing forty-two electricity transmission operators across thirty-five European countries,
ENTSO-E embarked on a journey in 2014 to integrate COBIT 5 into its IT processes.29 This strategic move was
aimed at refining the organization’s intricate IT infrastructure to support massive electricity flows, establish a
decade-long network development blueprint, and ensure a transparent, standardized energy transaction
framework across Europe. By embracing COBIT 5, ENTSO-E was able to fortify its IT governance, ensuring data
integrity, process efficiency, and a commitment to excellence in line with its ambitious mission.
As the framework evolved, they have continued to align their practices with the updated COBIT 2019 to
address emerging IT governance challenges.
ISO/IEC 27701
An extension to the ISO/IEC 27001 and ISO/IEC 27002 standards, the ISO/IEC 27701 provides guidelines for
establishing, implementing, and maintaining a privacy information management system (PIMS), which is a
framework or set of policies and procedures used by an organization to manage personal data and ensure
compliance with privacy laws and regulations.
ISO/IEC 27701 is particularly vital given the volume of international and regional data protection laws such as
the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in the European Union and the California Consumer Privacy Act
(CCPA) in the United States.
The key highlights of ISO/IEC 27701 include three levels (Table 6.2):
•
Frameworks and Standards (Top Level): These are the overarching guidelines that organizations follow. For
instance, ISO/IEC 27001 is the standard for managing information security, while ISO/IEC 27701 focuses
on privacy.
•
Systems (Middle Level): The frameworks lead to the creation of specific systems such as ISMS and PIMS,
which are implemented within organizations to protect information and ensure compliance.
•
Sector-Specific Applications (Bottom Level): The standards and systems are applied differently across
sectors, acknowledging that each has specific requirements and challenges.

NIST Privacy Framework
In January 2020, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) released its Privacy Framework to
address the challenges of increasing data privacy risks. This framework complements the NIST Cybersecurity
Framework, specifically focusing on managing privacy risks by promoting the idea of Privacy by Design, which
is a concept and approach in system engineering and data handling practices that integrates privacy and data
protection measures from the very beginning of the design process, rather than as an afterthought.
The NIST Risk Management Framework allows enterprises to translate high-level, principles-based legal
requirements into tangible technical privacy controls. Figure 6.6 outlines the Risk Management Framework
steps, serving as a blueprint for organizations to tailor their own cybersecurity strategies. Notably, it
incorporates guidance from a suite of NIST standards. For instance, NIST SP 800-39 offers a broad overview for
managing information security risk organization-wide, while IR 8062 provides a nuanced approach to privacy
engineering and risk management. SP 800-30, on the other hand, specializes in risk assessments, helping
organizations identify, evaluate, and prioritize risks.

Standards and Technology, Public Domain)
As we advance further into the era of data-driven decision-making and digital innovation, these frameworks
and regulations play a dual role. First, they provide a framework to guard against potential risks, and second,
they lay the foundation for businesses to innovate responsibly, ensuring that user trust isn’t compromised.
National Regulations outside the United States and the European Union
The growing number of regulations and standards creates complexity for multinational companies, requiring
significant resources and expertise to comply with different, sometimes conflicting, regulations. These
challenges include addressing security risks due to inadequate security controls in IoT devices, differing
standards across devices, and issues of data sovereignty in cloud-based platforms and access controls.
International alignment and cooperation in data privacy regulations is crucial, as it simplifies compliance for
global businesses and facilitates international trade and data flows.
In a globalized world where technology transcends borders, the protection of user information, data security,
and privacy controls is a shared concern among nations, although each country has its own regulatory laws.
Just as the United States has put in place various agencies and standards to oversee data protection, other
nations across Asia, South America, and Africa have crafted comparable frameworks to safeguard user
information.
China: Personal Information Protection Law
China’s Personal Information Protection Law (PIPL), introduced in 2021, marks the country’s first major data
6.3 • Data Security and Privacy from a Global Perspective
233

privacy law. This law is crucial for ensuring that personal information collected within China remains within its
borders—a concept known as data localization. PIPL sets very strict rules for sharing data with other countries,
meaning that companies must meet specific requirements before transferring data out of China. These
requirements include getting certifications or contracts that align with Chinese standards.
Japan: Act on the Protection of Personal Information
Japan’s Act on the Protection of Personal Information (APPI) has been a key part of the country’s data privacy
laws since it was first enacted in 2003. Recognizing the growing importance of global data protection, Japan
made significant changes to the APPI in 2017 to update it in line with international standards, such as the
European Union’s GDPR. The APPI focuses heavily on individual rights, ensuring that people have control over
their personal data. This includes the right to access their data, correct any inaccuracies, and decide how their
data are used. Businesses are required to clearly explain why they are collecting personal data and must
obtain explicit consent from individuals.
South Africa: Protection of Personal Information Act
South Africa’s Protection of Personal Information Act (POPIA), which became fully effective in 2021, is designed
to protect the privacy of personal data within the country. POPIA applies to any organization that processes
personal information in South Africa, whether the data are processed automatically (like on a computer) or
manually. The law requires that organizations are transparent about why they are collecting personal data and
that they get consent from individuals when necessary. POPIA also emphasizes the importance of lawful
processing, meaning that data can only be used for legitimate purposes. Furthermore, organizations must
appoint an information officer to oversee compliance with POPIA, ensuring that the organization follows the
regulations.
Industry-Specific Regulations and Standards
In the rapidly evolving landscape of information security, two frameworks stand out for their comprehensive
approach and widespread adoption: the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) and ISO/IEC
27001 (Table 6.3). PCI DSS, a global security framework, sets the standard for safeguarding cardholder
information, thereby playing a crucial role in mitigating credit card fraud.

Table 6.3 Industry-Specific Regulations and Standards The PCI DSS and ISO/IEC 27001 purposes, governance, data protection,
security measures, and impact on organizations are laid out in their frameworks.
The enforcement of these security standards and regulations typically involves a combination of government
oversight, industry self-regulation, and third-party audits. Government agencies in various countries develop
and enforce regulations, often imposing penalties for noncompliance, which can include fines, legal action, or
operational restrictions. Compliance with these standards is often verified through third-party audits
conducted by accredited certification bodies, which assess whether organizations meet the required security
and privacy benchmarks.
Effective collaboration between nations, industries, and regulatory bodies is essential in shaping a coherent,
effective approach to data protection in the globalized digital age.
Case Study: Attaining ISO/IEC 27001 Certification
Information security remains at the forefront of organizational priorities, particularly as data breaches and
cyber threats become increasingly sophisticated. The ISO/IEC 27001 certification differentiates organizations
that have excelled in establishing robust information security processes and procedures to safeguard crucial
data. Additionally, organizations that meet this standard are better equipped to prevent data breaches and
protect essential data. This case study delves into the experience of a Texas-based data center, a facility
designed to host computer systems and related components, as it tackled the challenges of securing this vital
certification during the global COVID-19 pandemic.
Background: The ISO/IEC 27001 Standard
The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and the International Electrotechnical Commission
(IEC) jointly developed ISO/IEC 27001. This globally recognized standard specifies the requirements for
establishing, implementing, maintaining, and continuously improving an information security management
system (ISMS). An organization that achieves this certification demonstrates its commitment to information
6.3 • Data Security and Privacy from a Global Perspective
235

security and data privacy, meeting international standards of excellence.
ISO/IEC 27001 certification is achieved through a rigorous process facilitated by a certification body, which is
an organization accredited to assess and certify that companies, systems, processes, or products meet the
established standards and requirements. The traditional method to obtain this certification involves
undergoing an audit, a systematic examination and evaluation of an organization’s records, compliance with
regulatory standards, and the integrity of financial reporting processes.
The Challenge: Certification during a Pandemic
In April 2020, Lone Star Data Hub, a data center located in Austin, Texas, embarked on a journey to achieve
ISO/IEC 27001 certification. For Lone Star Data Hub, known for managing critical data infrastructure for
regional clients in sectors such as finance and health care, this certification was more than just a seal of
approval. It was a strategic business move aimed at setting their services apart in a competitive market.
Obtaining ISO/IEC 27001 certification would underscore the center’s dedication to stringent information
security standards and enhance its appeal to a broad client base, including Fortune 500 companies. This
certification was seen as a crucial step in demonstrating their commitment to protecting sensitive data and
maintaining the highest level of security. However, the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic introduced a myriad of
challenges, specifically, nationwide lockdowns, social distancing mandates, and the transition to remote work.
To meet the challenges of this certification process, the data center sought a certification body with a solid
reputation, even in remote settings. Guided by a recommendation from another auditor and the influence of
stakeholders with a comprehensive background in information security, they selected the National Sanitation
Foundation; International Strategic Registrations chapter (NSF-ISR).
The ensuing audit was thoroughly planned, with NSF-ISR providing a comprehensive agenda designed to allow
the data center to operate seamlessly, ensuring minimal disruption to its ongoing operations. The audit
process involved a detailed examination of the data center’s information security practices, including
assessments of security controls, risk management processes, and compliance with ISO/IEC 27001 standards.
This balanced approach provided the data center with invaluable insights, highlighting areas of strength and
those needing improvement.

and management systems in place. By going through the tour, you’ll get an insider’s look into the rigorous
security measures and operational protocols that these certified facilities maintain. This will help you better
understand the significance and implementation challenges of achieving ISO/IEC 27001 certification, and
also deepen your understanding of how ISO/IEC 27001 principles are applied in a real-world setting.
Remote Auditing: A New Paradigm
The adoption of remote auditing, a practice in which an audit is conducted off-site via video or other
technological means, marked a significant shift in the certification process. Traditionally, auditors would be
present on-site, directly interacting with systems and personnel. However, the pandemic’s constraints
necessitated a different approach. NSF-ISR leveraged digital tools and technologies to assess the data center’s
systems, processes, and policies. During the remote audit, NSF-ISR measured various aspects, including the
effectiveness of security controls, the alignment of practices with ISO/IEC 27001 standards, and the overall
security posture of the data center. This assessment was conducted through virtual meetings, screen sharing
sessions, and digital document reviews, which have become a new norm. While this mode of auditing was

novel, it demonstrated that with the right tools and expertise, remote evaluations could be just as effective as
their in-person counterparts.
Achieving Certification: Implications and Benefits
The meticulous audit culminated in the data center obtaining its ISO/IEC 27001 certification. This achievement
also signaled an auditor’s adeptness in remotely verifying an ISMS. For the Texas-based data center, this
certification expanded the company’s market opportunities, enabling it to respond to business opportunities
that mandated stringent information security practices. As more organizations prioritize data security, the
demand for ISO/IEC 27001-certified entities is poised to grow.
6.4 Managing Enterprise Risk and Compliance
Learning Objectives
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
•
Evaluate policies and discern whether they comply with global frameworks
•
Identify gaps and assess risks in an enterprise’s policies
•
Describe the processes involved in developing, implementing, and monitoring new policies and
protocols
As you have learned, the responsibility of safeguarding data security and privacy is not just a regulatory
requirement: it is also a cornerstone of business success in our modern data-driven age. For enterprise
organizations, this requires compliance --the adherence to laws, regulations, and policies governing an
industry or operation --to various frameworks. Additionally, it involves a deeper commitment to understanding
and continually aligning internal policies and protocols. An entity’s policy consists of defined guidelines and
procedures established by the organization to regulate actions and ensure compliance with legal and ethical
standards. Its protocols are the specific, detailed procedures or rules designed to implement policies in
practical terms; for example, a data security protocol might specify encryption standards, access controls, and
incident response measures to enforce the privacy policy. Aligning policies and protocols with data protection
standards is necessary because in today’s digital economy businesses increasingly rely on customer data to
drive decision-making, innovation, and personalized services. Therefore, earning and maintaining customer
trust by responsibly managing their data is essential. This is all achieved by managing enterprise risk and
compliance.
Auditing Policy Compliance to a Global Framework
Aligning with global frameworks such as GDPR is an essential step in ensuring that organizations have strong
data security and privacy policies. But how exactly does this alignment occur, and what are the specifics
involved in ensuring compliance with such a framework? It starts with understanding the GDPR standards and
then auditing how well the company’s data and data processing activities perform against those standards. An
audit is a systematic evaluation of an organization’s data privacy and security practices.
Key Principles of GDPR
The GDPR is built around seven key principles: lawfulness, fairness, and transparency; purpose limitation; data
minimization; accuracy; storage limitation; integrity and confidentiality (security); and accountability.
Understanding these principles is the foundation of any GDPR compliance audit. An audit should begin with an
assessment of areas of potential need. Table 6.4 shows an example of how a company might identify potential
actions to take in each area.

Table 6.4 Principal Application in Facebook Audit A company can begin an audit by assessing how effectively its policies and
protocols are in aligning to the seven key principles of GDPR.
Data Mapping
An audit requires knowing where all types of personal data are stored, processed, and transferred within the
organization. Data mapping serves as an essential precursor to effective data governance and compliance. A
data mapping tool—which is a software application or platform that enables data professionals to automate
the process of mapping data fields, attributes, or elements from source systems to target systems or
destinations—can be especially useful here. The tools listed in Table 6.5 can automate this process, identifying
various data storage points across the organization’s infrastructure, including cloud services, databases, and
even employee devices.

Table 6.5 Data Mapping Tools Data mapping tools can help facilitate parts of an audit.
These data mapping tools offer advantages that go beyond mere identification. They can also categorize the
identified data according to its sensitivity and the privacy risks it presents, thereby aiding in the prioritization
of data protection efforts. For instance, personal identifiers such as Social Security numbers or medical records
may be flagged as high-risk data requiring stricter security measures. By providing a more structured, visual
representation of how data flows and resides within an organization, these tools allow for more effective
planning and implementation of data privacy policies.
Data Processing Activities
The GDPR requires organizations to document how they process data. Therefore, understanding what kind of
data are being collected, for what purpose, and how it is being processed and stored is essential. Additionally,
the regulation mandates that companies maintain a detailed record of their data processing activities, from
data collection to storage and eventual deletion.
This recordkeeping is not just a compliance requirement—it also serves a strategic function by fostering a
culture of accountability and transparency. Failing to adhere to this detailed level of documentation can lead to
significant legal consequences under GDPR.
In the context of Facebook, which faced public scrutiny for its data handling practices during the Cambridge
Analytica scandal, GDPR compliance required the company to reevaluate its third-party app policies
meticulously. Specifically, Facebook needed to document the kind of user data that was being accessed by
third-party apps and for what purpose. This finding led Facebook to make changes in its API permissions,
6.4 • Managing Enterprise Risk and Compliance
239

ensuring that data access by third-party apps would be more restricted and better aligned with GDPR
principles. For example, apps would need explicit user consent to collect data and would be limited in what
types of data they could collect. Not only does this practice protect the rights of individuals, but it also helps
organizations minimize risks and liabilities by ensuring that each data processing activity has a lawful basis
and specific purpose.
GDPR Compliance Checklist
Checklists can help an organization ensure that it hasn’t missed any critical elements during an audit. Creating
a GDPR compliance checklist is an invaluable step in ensuring that all regulatory requirements are met and
that no critical elements are overlooked during the audit process. Checklists serve as both a road map for the
initial steps of becoming compliant and a measure for ongoing compliance measures. Following that, the
checklist usually breaks down GDPR’s key principles and provisions into actionable items. For instance, under
the principle of “lawfulness, fairness, and transparency,” items on the checklist could include establishing
lawful bases for data processing, drafting clear and transparent privacy notices, and setting up mechanisms
for obtaining and recording consents.
Regular reviews and updates to the checklist are necessary for maintaining compliance, especially in a rapidly
evolving digital landscape. Creating and following a detailed GDPR compliance checklist demonstrates a
proactive approach to data protection and serves as documentary evidence of an organization’s commitment
to compliance, which can be particularly useful if regulatory scrutiny ever occurs.
Identifying Gaps and Risks
Aligning with global frameworks is not a one-time task. The dynamic nature of technology, along with changes
in regulation and emerging threats, means that organizations must constantly identify and address gaps and
risks in their policies. Keeping an enterprise compliant is an ongoing process that demands vigilance, insight,
and a proactive approach to risk management. Knowing how to perform a gap analysis, evaluate compliance
with global frameworks, and navigate the complex terrain of enterprise risk policies is important for building
and maintaining robust and compliant data management systems, and for effectively managing risks in the
ever-evolving landscape of enterprise security.
Gap Analysis
The foundation of strong enterprise risk management lies in an organization’s ability to perform a gap
analysis, which is an evaluation of existing policies and protocols, identifying weaknesses and areas that
might not align with global data security and privacy standards. As international regulations evolve,
organizations must be agile, adjusting their policies to ensure they remain in compliance with frameworks
such as GDPR, CCPA, HIPAA, and others. The ability to evaluate and adapt to these global frameworks is more
than just a legal necessity; it’s a strategic move that can enhance a business’s reputation and consequently its
ability to gain and maintain consumer trust.
Risk Assessment
The process of identifying potential risks that could negatively impact an organization’s assets and business
operations and evaluating potential negative outcomes and the likelihood of them occurring is called risk
assessment. Every data processing activity carries a level of risk, which must be assessed and mitigated. One
of the most comprehensive ways to conduct a risk assessment in the context of GDPR is to perform a data
protection impact assessment (DPIA). A DPIA is a structured analysis that maps out how personal data are
processed and how to minimize the data protection risks to individuals. It often involves evaluating the
necessity and proportionality of the data processing activities and requires consultation with relevant
stakeholders, including data protection officers (DPOs) and potentially even the data subjects themselves.
For example, an organization would need to conduct a DPIA when changing how user data are shared with
third-party apps. This would involve scrutinizing the types of data being shared, the potential risks of this
240
6 • Enterprise Security, Data Privacy, and Risk Management
Access for free at openstax.org

sharing to user privacy, and the measures that could mitigate these risks. They would assess whether the data
sharing is necessary for the service to function or whether less intrusive methods are available. Moreover, the
DPIA would investigate security measures to ensure the third-party apps have adequate protections in place.
After identifying and quantifying risks, the organization then needs to establish measures to mitigate them.
These could range from technical solutions such as encryption and access controls to policy measures such as
stricter consent requirements or limitations on data sharing. This step also involves determining the residual
risks, or the risks remaining after mitigation, to ensure they fall within acceptable levels.
Finally, GDPR requires that risk assessments are not a one-time activity. Risks need to be periodically reviewed
and updated, especially when there is a significant change in data processing activities or when there are new
insights into potential vulnerabilities and threats. Conducting regular risk assessments and DPIAs
demonstrates an organization’s commitment to data protection, and it’s also a key requirement for GDPR
compliance.
Developing, Implementing, and Monitoring Policies and Protocols
An assessment of gaps and risks is an audit that helps identify where an organization’s policies and practices
align with or deviate from global standards, and it aims to establish the current situation. Once complete, an
organization needs to take the findings of the initial audit and use them as a starting point for creating a
concrete action plan, which is a detailed outline of steps to be taken to achieve a particular goal. This includes
creating new policies and protocols that will bring the organization into compliance with GDPR. This goes
beyond mere assessment to provide a road map for achieving compliance, which involves identifying what
needs to be done and detailing how to do it.
New Policies and Protocols
The first step involves creating new policies that align with GDPR requirements. For example, this might mean
overhauling the company’s existing third-party data sharing agreements to include more explicit consent
mechanisms. When Facebook was faced with this need, it introduced a “Privacy Checkup” tool that serves as a
proactive measure to empower users to control their personal information and privacy settings.30
This feature guides users through a step-by-step process to review who can see their posts, what kind of
personal information is visible to others, and what apps have access to their data. Not only does the Privacy
Checkup tool allow users to understand and configure their settings, but it also aligns with Facebook’s
obligation under GDPR to make data collection transparent and easily understandable. By implementing such
a tool, Facebook is also demonstrating accountability—another key GDPR principle—as it shows the company’s
active efforts to help users manage their privacy. Table 6.6 provides some examples of new or updated policies
an organization might introduce after an audit of GDPR compliance.

take to improve compliance with GDPR.
Legal and Internal Reviews
Any new policies must undergo a legal review to ensure they are compliant with GDPR standards. They should
also be vetted by different departments within the organization to check for feasibility, practicality, and
effectiveness.
•
Legal review for GDPR compliance: Before any policy is finalized, it needs to be reviewed by legal experts
specializing in data protection and compliance. For instance, Microsoft undertook a comprehensive legal
review when GDPR was introduced to ensure all its products and services were complying.31
•
Departmental review for feasibility: Once the legal review confirms the draft policies follow GDPR, the next
step is to vet them through the various departments that will be impacted. Each department can give
insights into how practicable the new policies are. For example, when Salesforce implemented new privacy
policies, it engaged multiple departments, including marketing, sales, and customer service, to ensure
operational feasibility.32
•
Executive approval for effectiveness: The final arbiter in the review process is typically the executive
leadership of the organization. Its buy-in is critical not just for approval, but also for the effective
implementation of the policies. Amazon’s leadership, for example, plays an active role in the review and
approval of compliance policies, as evidenced by the company’s public corporate governance guidelines.33
Employee Training
Employees need to be educated about any new policies to ensure company-wide compliance. Training
sessions, workshops, and regular updates can serve this purpose. Educating employees about new policies is
critical for ensuring that the entire organization adheres to compliance standards. This involves a
comprehensive and sustained effort, involving multiple training formats and ongoing updates such as those
listed in Table 6.7.

Policy Implementation
Implementing new policies to align data handling practices with GDPR requirements turns assessment
findings into actionable practices. For example, if gaps in consent management are identified, systems should
be updated to ensure explicit opt-ins and proper recording of user consent. Similarly, if high-risk activities are
found, the organization might introduce measures such as encryption or stricter access controls. Effective
implementation often requires coordination across multiple systems and departments, ensuring that changes
are consistent and integrated throughout the organization. Table 6.8 gives some examples of implementation
strategies a company might use.

Table 6.8 IT Implementation Strategies and Descriptions Useful strategies for implementing new data policies include system-
wide software updates, back-end process overhauls, and employee training.
Communication
Once new policies are in place, communicating these changes to end users is critical. This could occur via
emails, updated terms of service, or in-app notifications, for example. Transparent and timely communication
with end users is key to maintaining trust and ensuring that new policies are understood and followed. Here
are three ways an organization can communicate these changes effectively:
•
Email notification: An organization can distribute a comprehensive email to all users, providing an
executive summary of what changes have been made in the data privacy policy, why these changes were
necessary, and what users need to do, if anything, in response. The email should also provide a link to the
updated full text of the policy for those who desire to review it in detail. This also includes positive receipt
of notification indicating the changes to the policy have been read. An example of such a transparent
approach can be found in the way Dropbox communicated its privacy policy changes in 2023.34
•
In-app pop-up: Another effective way of ensuring the message reaches the user base is through an in-app
pop-up notification. This notification can appear when users log in to the app after the policy changes
have been enacted, offering them a brief overview of the changes, and directing them to more detailed
information. X (formerly Twitter), for instance, employed this strategy when the company updated its
terms of service in 2023.35
•
Social media announcements: In addition to email and direct communication through the platform,
leveraging other social media channels to announce changes can also be useful. A series of posts
explaining the key changes in easy-to-understand language can be made on platforms such as Instagram,
LinkedIn, or X to broaden the reach. Google took to its blog and social media to explain changes when the
company updated its privacy policy in 2020.36

Continuous Monitoring and Auditing
Continuous monitoring and auditing are vital in ensuring that the changes implemented are not merely a one-
time fix but are effectively integrated into an organization’s ongoing operations. This involves conducting a
mix of automated and manual reviews aimed at regularly validating an organization’s compliance with GDPR.
Establishing a schedule for routine audits and assessments is key, as it provides structured intervals for
scrutiny, which in turn minimizes the risk of noncompliance creeping back into the organization’s practices
over time.
Table 6.9 describes the actions needed to monitor and audit data handling and who is responsible for each
action; it also features time frames for the implementation of each task.

Case Study: Facebook Gap Analysis, Risk Assessment, and Policy Changes
One real-world example that highlights the need for robust data security and privacy protocols involves the
gaps that surfaced in the policies of Facebook (now Meta) during the Cambridge Analytica scandal. In March
2018, it was revealed that the data of around 87 million Facebook users had been harvested without consent
by a third-party app and sold to Cambridge Analytica, a political consulting firm. The incident sparked global
outrage, leading to intense scrutiny of Facebook’s data privacy practices, and eventually resulting in significant
regulatory action.
This case study explores the processes enacted during Facebook’s audit, gap analysis, risk assessment, and
policy development and implementation.
Facebook’s approach began by identifying the scope and objectives of its audit. The focus was on how
management could address the challenges and gaps in its data privacy practices to align with global
standards. The scope was to examine how Facebook’s failure to protect user data led to unauthorized access
by Cambridge Analytica, exposing significant flaws in data management and user privacy. The primary
6.4 • Managing Enterprise Risk and Compliance
245

objective was to bring Facebook’s data privacy policies into compliance with global standards such as GDPR,
ensuring management’s responsibility for implementing necessary changes.
Facebook conducted a detailed examination of existing policies, with a critical eye toward identifying
vulnerabilities and areas for improvement. Although the pre-incident policies that allowed third-party apps to
access Facebook users’ data were compliant with existing laws, they were found to be risky. This situation
highlighted the importance of not only complying with legal requirements, but also adhering to privacy best
practices to protect users’ personal information.
The next phase involved comparing Facebook’s practices to the stringent requirements of the EU’s GDPR.
GDPR emphasizes principles such as data minimization and transparency, both of which were lacking in
Facebook’s existing data sharing approach. The principle of data minimization ensures that organizations
only collect, process, and store the minimum amount of personal data necessary for its purpose. Identifying
specific areas where compliance with international standards was lacking underscored the need for targeted
interventions.37
Next was the process of identifying gaps and weaknesses which involved a meticulous examination of areas
where policies, procedures, and practices fell short. This step pinpointed specific areas that needed to be
addressed to enhance data protection and user privacy. In the case of Facebook, the company conducted an
audit and found gaps in its own user consent management, data sharing controls, and third-party data access
monitoring. It then laid out a plan to address these areas systematically.
Risk evaluation considers potential negative consequences resulting from gaps and weaknesses. For
Facebook, the risks included substantial regulatory fines (such as a $5 billion fine by the FTC), potential
reputational damage, and the loss of user trust. For any organization, understanding these risks is essential in
prioritizing and tailoring the response to ensure that the most significant threats are addressed promptly.
Based on the identified gaps and assessed risks, Facebook needed to develop clear and actionable plans to
rectify its shortcomings. This included implementing changes to limit third-party access, which is access to
data from an external entity to user data, enhancing user consent mechanisms, and increasing transparency
regarding data usage.
The implementation phase is where planned changes are executed. Facebook, in response to heightened data
privacy concerns, began to conduct more robust audits of third-party developers, enhancing oversight and
adhering to stricter data privacy standards. To ensure these changes were not just one-off adjustments but
part of a sustained compliance strategy, Facebook instituted continuous monitoring measures. These
measures include regular reviews of data access and usage by third-party developers, the use of advanced
analytics to detect and respond to unusual patterns indicative of potential data misuse, and ongoing updates
to their data privacy policies and practices in line with evolving regulations and user expectations. Continuous
monitoring of compliance ensures that the changes not only effectively address identified gaps, but also that
ongoing compliance is maintained, adapting to new challenges and regulatory requirements as they arise.
Documenting and reporting are final steps that are vital in maintaining transparency and trust. Facebook
increased transparency with users and regulators through public reports and regular updates on privacy
measures, reinforcing the importance of management’s role in driving these changes.
Facebook’s reevaluation of its data security and privacy policies after the Cambridge Analytica scandal
illustrates the process of aligning corporate practices with global standards. It also serves as a lesson for
organizations to be vigilant in protecting user privacy, ensuring compliance with regulatory frameworks, and
establishing transparent communication with stakeholders.

ETHICS IN IS
Ethical Considerations in Gap Analysis
In 2022, Uber faced significant backlash after a data breach exposed the personal information of millions of
users. This incident underscores the ethical responsibilities companies have when managing sensitive data.
The gap analysis process is not just about compliance but also about upholding ethical standards to protect
user trust.
Key ethical considerations before a gap analysis include:
•
Informed consent: Ensure users fully understand and agree to how their data will be used and stored.
•
Transparency: Be clear and open about data collection, storage, and sharing practices.
•
Trust: Protect the trust users place in your organization by implementing robust data protection
measures.
•
Accountability: If gaps are found, be transparent and take responsibility to address them immediately.
Ethical actions after a gap analysis include:
•
Communicate clearly: Inform stakeholders promptly if any vulnerabilities are detected.
•
Implement changes responsibly: Address any identified gaps with a focus on ethical responsibility, not
just legal compliance.
•
Ongoing monitoring: Continuously audit and monitor data practices to ensure ongoing protection and
trust.
By integrating these ethical considerations into your gap analysis, the organization can enhance data
security and build a culture of trust and accountability.

Summary
6.1 Key Concepts in Data Privacy and Data Security
•
Data privacy and security involve protecting data from unauthorized access and ensuring confidentiality,
integrity, and availability; they are essential for maintaining trust and reputation, preventing financial loss,
and reducing operational risks in enterprises.
•
The transition of businesses to digital platforms has increased the susceptibility of information to
breaches and unauthorized disclosures, emphasizing the impact of enterprise security and risk policies on
data privacy in a digital landscape.
•
Data privacy and security have transcended being mere IT issues to become crucial elements of strategic
planning for businesses, necessitating significant investment in data security measures and privacy
protocols to maintain customer trust and comply with regulations.
•
The growing awareness and concern among consumers about their data privacy means businesses must
enhance their data protection efforts, as consumers are increasingly likely to switch away from companies
with poor data practices.
•
Security policies extend to managing risks associated with third parties such as cloud service providers
and data analytics firms, requiring regular audits, and secure data handling agreements.
•
Data privacy regulations and standards, both regional and international, ensure the safeguarding of
personal information and provide a standardized approach for businesses to manage data privacy.
6 • Summary
249

6.2 Vulnerabilities and Threats in Web Applications and IoT Technology
•
The rapid advancement of digital technologies, including IoT and mobile, has introduced significant
vulnerabilities.
•
The expansion of IoT and web applications has integrated technology into every facet of modern life,
increasing the responsibility of enterprises and IT professionals to ethically manage and secure these
interconnected ecosystems.
•
Security strategies include both preventive and reactive measures intended to combat security threats in
web and IoT technologies, preparing future IT professionals to effectively protect digital environments.
•
Regulatory frameworks and standards developed by organizations such as ISO and IEEE are essential for
enhancing security, interoperability, and quality in the digital ecosystem, particularly in the
underregulated IoT sector and its global reach.
6.3 Data Security and Privacy from a Global Perspective
•
The ISO/IEC 27001 standard is a key global framework for data security and privacy. It serves as an
international regulation that sets specific requirements for information security management systems
(ISMSs).
•
The global landscape of data security and privacy is a combination of intricate regulations, standards, and
best practices that reflects the diverse concerns of different regions and industries. It is in a perpetual
state of evolution.
•
Some of the most well-known standards are the globally recognized COBIT 2019 Framework, the
Enterprise Privacy Risk Management Framework, ISO/IEC 27701, and the NIST Privacy Framework.
•
While the United States has put in place various agencies and standards to oversee data protection, other
countries across Asia, South America, Africa, as well as various industries have crafted similar frameworks
to safeguard user information.
•
The case study provides important insights on the strategic importance of global certifications, the need
for flexibility, and the value of expert auditors in navigating global regulations and frameworks.
6.4 Managing Enterprise Risk and Compliance
•
Enterprises can significantly benefit from conducting an audit and gap analysis to determine compliance
with global frameworks, a critical process that helps identify discrepancies between current data security
and privacy practices and industry-wide best practices or regulatory requirements. A gap analysis is
invaluable for pinpointing areas where policies may leave the company or its users’ data vulnerable to
various risks.
•
Introducing new data privacy and protection policies is a critical step for any organization aiming for GDPR
compliance. These policies undergo a thorough legal review to ensure they meet GDPR standards and are
also vetted internally across various departments to check for operational feasibility and effectiveness.
•
To ensure company-wide compliance, it’s essential to conduct comprehensive employee training on new
data protection policies. This involves a mix of e-learning courses, live workshops, regular updates, and,
for certain roles, specific certification programs to ensure that every member of the organization
understands and can effectively apply these policies.
•
Continuous improvement is key in GDPR compliance, which involves regular policy reviews, automated
compliance monitoring, and audits. Equally important is transparent and effective communication with
end users regarding any policy changes to maintain trust and compliance.
