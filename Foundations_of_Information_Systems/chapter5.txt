Introduction
Imagine carrying important documents, such as a paycheck or a diploma, when it starts to rain. Without an
umbrella, your documents can be damaged, although it may be possible to reprint them. However, if the rain
turned into a violent storm, you’d need much more protection to keep your documents safe. Similarly, in
information technology, our digital lives are constantly threatened by malicious actors, rogue governments,
and natural disasters.
Just as an umbrella alone isn't enough to protect someone from a storm, people rely on multiple layers of
protection to shield their digital lives. As a person navigates the digital landscape, layers of security help keep
them safe, preventing severe damage that’s much harder to remediate.

may be considered safe today may not be in the future. The ever-changing nature of this field necessitates a
comprehensive understanding of various technologies and advancements that influence security. The
implications of a network security breach can be diverse, ranging from minor disruptions in operations, to
severe data loss or compromise. Therefore, understanding the significance of network security can contribute
to a larger societal benefit. It is important for IS professionals to have a conceptual understanding of network
security, its mechanics, and why this protection is a key aspect of modern life, as well as the practical skills
needed in securing a network.
Information Security and Information Privacy on a Public or Private
Network
In the field of cybersecurity—which is the practice of protecting systems, networks, devices, and data from
online threats—information security and information privacy are not identical terms, although they are
related. On one hand, information security is the practice of protecting information by mitigating
information risks and vulnerabilities, which encompasses data privacy, data confidentiality, data integrity, and
data availability and employs methods such as encryption, firewalls, and secure network design. Its aim is to
shield both organizational and individual data from unauthorized access or tampering. In contrast,
information privacy involves the right and measure of control individuals have over the collection, storage,
management, and dissemination of personal information. Information privacy involves policies regarding
what data are collected, how they are stored, and who has access to share information.
The two domains of information privacy and information security are not static; they are influenced by
technological advancements and emerging threats. This makes continuous learning and adaptation important
for anyone interested in the field. Both students and seasoned professionals need to maintain their skills and
understanding to keep up with advancements in the field. This may include learning about the latest
encryption methods or understanding new data privacy laws that impact the organization.
Although both information security and information privacy are equally important, they tackle different
aspects of data protection. Think of information security as a bouncer at a club. Its job is to keep unwanted
guests out, so it uses tools such as encryption to hide the important data, firewalls to block unauthorized
entry, and secure networks to chase away any intruders. Information privacy, then, is more like getting access
to the VIP room inside that club. It manages who gets in, who sees what, and what goes on inside. Imagine
you have a list of the criteria for who can access the VIP room. When you’re not updating it, you keep it locked
in a special drawer that only you have the key to, thus keeping the contents private. But privacy also includes
making sure unauthorized people do not know who is on that list, or even that it exists.
In short, information security is about guarding the perimeter and protecting your assets, while information
privacy is about managing access and keeping sensitive data private. Both are essential, but they play different
roles in keeping your digital world safe. At the core of both information security and information privacy is a
foundational model in cybersecurity that ensures information is protected and readily available to authorized
users, called the confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA) triad (Figure 5.2).

promoting the security and reliability of information systems. (attribution: Copyright Rice University, OpenStax, under CC BY 4.0
license)
The CIA triad is the backbone for creating cybersecurity systems, aiming to strike a balance between keeping
things secure and ensuring that the people who are authorized to access the data and systems have access to
it. As the name implies, the CIA triad is divided into three domains:
1.
The measures that are meant to prevent sensitive information from being accessed by bad actors or by
those users who have not been granted access is called confidentiality. The intent is to keep data in the
correct hands and away from those who want to cause harm or exploit information for nefarious
purposes. Additionally, confidentiality addresses policies involving human error, such as users not keeping
strong passwords, failing to secure sensitive information when not in use, and falling prey to scammers.
Scams often involve phishing, which is a type of social engineering attack that appears as a trustworthy
entity in digital communication but steals user data, such as login credentials and financial information.
Two means of applying confidentiality to an IT system are encryption and access controls.
2.
Preserving the fidelity of data over its life cycle is called integrity. Any alteration to database tables, user
records, or other data can be very damaging, often causing legal ramifications or loss of operations. Two
means of maintaining the integrity of data are hashing and digital signatures.
◦
The process of converting data into a fixed-size string of characters, typically used for security purposes
to ensure data integrity, is called hashing. Hashing can verify the authenticity of a file by assigning a
hash algorithm, such as Secure Hashing Algorithm 256 (SHA-256) that has a 64-character hexadecimal
hash value assigned to the file by the algorithm. This results in a hash of characters that represent
every point of data in the file, bit by bit. Even the smallest change in the file results in a drastically
different chain of characters.
◦
An electronic signature that uses cryptographic techniques to provide authentication and ensure the
integrity of the signed digital document or message is a digital signature. They are used in online
documents such as emails, bank documents, and online forms, and employ the public key
infrastructure (PKI) to protect the confidentiality and integrity of data during transit. This method works
by supplying a public and private key to each user transmitting information. Aside from protecting the
confidentiality and integrity of data during transit, this framework helps to verify the authenticity of a
file and its sender.
3.
Ensuring that authorized users can access resources such as networks, databases, and other systems is
called availability. This part of the triad often encompasses disaster recovery and response plans. There
are several ways to maintain availability, such as keeping up with upgrades on equipment and software,
maintaining backups in case of an attack or system failure, and ensuring that redundant systems are in

place to protect the IT system.
Think about the CIA triad like this: Imagine you have a personal diary, and you want to make sure nobody else
can read it. When you’re writing in it, you want to be able to access it easily, but when you put it away, you
want to feel confident that no one else can access it.
Storing your diary in a safe when you’re not using it is a way of keeping it confidential. You could also put a
seal on it, so if someone does try to tamper with it, you’ll know; that’s maintaining its integrity. Keeping the
safe somewhere close, so you can get to your diary whenever you need it ensures that it is always available to
you. This way, you’ve covered all the bases of the CIA triad.
Information Security
When we think of data, most of us envision pictures, documents, and videos. However, data come in all sorts of
formats, types, and sizes. While our media is an important piece of the data puzzle, other types are equally
important. Consider the security of passwords, bank account information, employee records, and text
messages. These types of data also require both information security and information privacy. For example, in
a workplace setting, protecting employee information involves encrypting sensitive data (information security)
and implementing privacy policies to regulate who can view or modify this data (information privacy).
Moreover, the landscape of data protection is becoming increasingly complex with the rise of generative AI.
Most organizations use generative AI, but only a third of them implement protection from generative AI
threats because most companies do not fully understand the dangers. Currently, generative AI benefits
attackers more than organizations, but that may change in the near future.1 This intersection of advanced
technology with traditional data types underscores the critical need for robust security measures.
Acknowledging opportunities and threats posed by generative AI, blockchain, and other emerging
technologies can help in developing more effective strategies to safeguard all forms of data.
Intellectual Property
Creations of the mind that are protected by law from unauthorized use or replication are called intellectual
property (IP). It can include inventions, literary and artistic works, designs, symbols, names, and images used
in commerce. IP is often a target for cybercriminals and nation-state threat actors looking to steal technology
for their own benefit. Imagine dedicating years of research and millions of dollars to an expensive project only
to lose the information to a hacker in minutes. Unfortunately, hackers may still be able to bypass security
controls to access an organization’s IP.
Financial Data
Financial data are considered sensitive information, which is data that require high levels of confidentiality and
security. Sensitive data can include financial data related to transactions and personal finance details, and
employee data involving personal and professional details. Protecting this information is crucial to helping
organizations prevent fraud, maintain stakeholder trust, and comply with governmental regulations. Security
measures used to protect financial data often use a layered approach beyond firewalls and encryption that
combines multiple security barriers and includes rigorous auditing and multi factor authentication.
Employee Data
Personally identifiable information, such as Social Security numbers and addresses, constitutes an entity such
as employee, customer, or student data. Although they may not seem very sensitive, these data are valuable to
hackers for identity theft, corporate espionage, harassment, and extortion. Organizations must use measures
such as encryption and the principle of least privilege to protect this information.

Network Configurations
Network configurations are the physical and logical elements that form a network, such as servers, routers,
switches, and software. A server is a powerful computer or computer program that provides data to other
computers (clients) over a network. A router is a device that forwards data packets to the appropriate parts of
a computer network. A switch is a device that connects and segments various components within a local
network. Access to these systems by bad actors or rogue employees can have dire consequences for an
organization. Unauthorized access to network configuration data could allow an attacker to map out a
network, identify weaknesses, and access private customer information.
Internet protocol addresses, along with media access control addresses, are essential elements of a network
that require protection. An internet protocol (IP) address is a unique identifier that allows a computer to be
addressed in order to communicate on the internet. A media access control (MAC) address is a unique
identifier that allows a computer to be addressed in order to communicate within a local area network. To gain
unauthorized access to a network, attackers often use a technique called port scanning for penetration or
determining an entry point. These scans allow an attacker to gather information about a network such as the
unique addresses of each of the components connected. With this information, hackers can spoof addresses,
which allows them to blend into the network undetected. To protect IP addresses and equipment identifiers,
organizations use VPNs or proxy servers to mask IP addresses and create a secure tunnel for employees
accessing information from remote locations. Passwords account for the largest vulnerability to a network due
to the human factor involved. According to Security Magazine, close to 75 percent of users are at risk for
compromise due to weak password practices.2 Additionally, it is also estimated that nearly 80 percent of data
breaches are caused by poor password management. To prevent attacks due to poor password practices,
organizational leaders should implement the policies shown in Table 5.1.

Information Privacy
Information privacy is a critical aspect of cybersecurity and encompasses the practices, policies, and
regulations that are designed to protect people and systems from unauthorized access and harm. This
includes protection from access to personally identifiable information (PII), health-care records, financial
statements, and data from devices such as smartphones, smartwatches, and other wearable tech.

5.1 • The Importance of Network Security
161

Understanding the principles behind establishing and preserving information privacy is key to ensuring that
data remains safeguarded while in transit and at rest.
Additionally, the concept of information privacy is based on a variety of policies and regulations that guide
leaders and managers on how to safeguard sensitive information. As the scope of data needing protection
continually expands, improvements are constantly being made to address the complexities of new, emerging
technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT), cloud computing, and artificial intelligence.
In addition, different sectors have their own specific frameworks and laws. In the United States, institutions
such as hospitals or those who deal with sensitive medical information must adhere to the guidelines outlined
in the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA). In the education sector, educational
institutions must adhere to the principles outlined in the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA).
HIPAA
Established in 1996, HIPAA was introduced by the Health and Human Services Department (HHS) to devise
legislation that would protect the privacy of those seeking medical care. One part of HIPAA, the Privacy Rule,
sets standards and guidelines for organizations that manage patient information and medical records of any
kind. This includes health plans, health-care providers, health-care clearinghouses, and business associates.
HIPAA provides rigorous standards for companies that possess and interact with a vast range of protected
health information (PHI), such as medical history, billing information, and patient identifiers. Moreover, HIPAA’s
controls do not apply solely to medical providers, but rather to any entity that may possess or have access to
patient data. This includes third parties who provide data hosting services, accounting firms, consultants, or
any entity contracted to maintain hosting services such as patient portals and websites.
In addition to the Privacy Rule, HIPAA has a Security Rule, which works with the Privacy Rule to lay out the
technical, administrative, and physical measures needed to protect electronic health information, thus tying
into the larger world of information security protocols. Failure to comply with HIPAA can result in significant
penalties, ranging from fines to criminal charges. These enforcement actions remind organizations to
thoroughly adhere to the established guidelines and to continually update their practices.
FERPA
FERPA is a U.S. federal law that was enacted in 1974. Its main goal is to give parents and students who are 18
years and older some control over their educational records. Specifically, FERPA sets rules on who can access
these records and under what circumstances. Educational institutions that receive federal funding are required
to comply with FERPA’s mandates, and noncompliance could result in the loss of that funding.
FERPA gives students and their parents the right to access their educational records, correct any mistakes, and
have a say in how that information is shared. While this sounds simple, the implementation can be complex.
For example, schools must have written consent to release information, but there are exceptions such as cases
involving subpoenas or emergencies. It is important to note that not all information is protected under FERPA.
Some types of directory information, such as a student’s name, address, and telephone number, can be
released without explicit consent, unless the student or parent opts out.4
To understand how FERPA protects academic information, consider a student attending a college away from
home whose parents demand to know their student’s test scores, homework assignments, and regular activity
in classes. Under FERPA guidelines, if the student is 18 years old or older, the only one who can release that
information to the parents is the student. Their parents would have no access to this type of information from
the school without the student’s explicit permission, except in health or safety emergencies.

Key Principles and Concepts of Network Security
In the complex world of cybersecurity, it is important for everyone to understand the foundational principles
of the threats to digital security and the ways to safeguard digital assets. Whether you are a student, a new
employee, or a boardroom executive, having a firm grasp on the key principles can help protect you from
digital harm.
Imagine you’re setting up a home network. You notice that your devices receive different IP addresses from
time to time. This is because many IP addresses are dynamic, changing with each connection. Now, visualize
managing a large corporate network where stability and reliability are critical. Here, a company can use a
static IP address, which is a permanent address assigned by an administrator that remains the same over
time and is essential for services such as hosting servers, email servers, and network devices, or when remote
access is required.
The consistency of a static IP address allows for reliable and straightforward network management, as well as
easier implementation of security measures because the address can be precisely identified and controlled.
Static IP addresses are used primarily for servers and network equipment. A dynamic IP address is one that is
assigned each time a device connects to the internet and changes periodically, although not necessarily every
time the device connects. This type of IP addressing is commonly used in residential and small business
settings, where internet service providers (ISPs) assign these addresses to customers, and in larger companies
for their client machines. Dynamic IP addressing is highly efficient for ISPs as it allows for the reuse and
reallocation of a limited pool of IP addresses, optimizing the use of the IP address space, especially given the
vast number of devices connecting and disconnecting from the internet.
The Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4) is the fourth version of the fundamental protocol used for identifying
devices on a network and routing data between them over the internet. It consists of four 8-bit groups that
make up 32 bits total. In any given IP address under the IPv4 system, the range cannot exceed 256 in any 8-bit
group; however, due to system limitations, addresses normally range from 0 to 255. The Internet Protocol
version 6 (IPv6) has eight hexadecimal groups that allow up to 128 bits. There are many differences between
these standards. For example, IPv6 can supply more security and a nearly limitless number of IP addresses (7.9
× 1028). IPv6 is more secure than IPv4 because it was designed with built-in support for Internet Protocol
Security (IPsec), which is a suite of protocols that provides end-to-end encryption and secure data exchange.
Additionally, its massive address space allows for more efficient address allocation, reducing the risks of IP
conflicts and improving overall network reliability.
Both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses often come accompanied by a subnet mask, which is an address used in routing
and network organization that divides the IP address into network and host addresses. One method for
allocating IP addresses is classless inter-domain routing (CIDR), which routes IP packets more efficiently
than traditional classful IP addressing. CIDR is a key element of the IPv4 addressing method, as it increases
efficiency and security by permitting the “borrowing” of bits of information to create a new range of IP
addresses to form a subnet, which is a logically visible subdivision of an IP network. The subnet mask and
CIDR help in segregating the network portion of an IP address from the host portion. This segregation is
important for routing and for defining network boundaries, as it permits for the proper distribution of
information and traffic to the intended recipient.
Another vital aspect of IP addressing is the way these addresses are allocated and managed. IPv4 addresses
were developed in 1981 and were initially distributed in an erratic manner, leading to inefficient use of the
address space. In contrast, IPv6 addresses are allocated based on a more hierarchical and organized structure,
allowing for easier management and better security protocols. This process is managed by several
organizations globally, such as the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) and the five Regional Internet
Registries (RIRs), ensuring a standardized approach to address allocation.
The Domain Name System (DNS) translates human-readable domain names to IP addresses, allowing users
5.1 • The Importance of Network Security
163

to access websites using familiar names. Essentially, it acts like a directory of the internet. This process is
fundamental to web navigation, as it makes it possible for people to access information online without
needing to remember complex numeric addresses. Just like a contact list keeps numbers, a DNS keeps IP
addresses. Also, just like a contact list, these numbers must be updated frequently as people and equipment
change. Figure 5.3 depicts how a DNS matches the client’s computer (i.e., IP address) to an organization’s
website. While DNS is integral to web navigation, it can be exploited for malicious purposes, such as DNS
spoofing, an attack where hackers corrupt DNS servers to redirect traffic to another server or website.
Figure 5.3 A DNS helps to identify and align the correct IP address to the URL. (attribution: Copyright Rice University, OpenStax,
under CC BY 4.0 license)
It is crucial to implement DNS security measures to mitigate vulnerabilities. One way is to use Domain Name
System Security Extensions (DNSSEC), a suite of extensions that add security by enabling DNS responses to be
digitally signed and verified. This verification process helps in safeguarding against DNS spoofing and other
types of DNS-based attacks. Furthermore, securing DNS resolvers with threat intelligence that prevents users
from accidentally visiting sites that could compromise their security can also help block known malicious
domains. Implementing these advanced DNS security measures is increasingly considered best practice in
both professional and consumer settings. One type of threat DNSSECs can prevent is those involving DNS
spoofing, such as a man-in-the-middle (MitM) attack, which is one that manipulates the DNS to redirect a
website’s traffic to a different IP address, often controlled by the attacker. This allows the attacker to intercept
and potentially modify the communication between the user and the intended website.
Another fundamental concept in network and information security is encryption, which transforms legible
data into a coded format, making it unreadable to unauthorized entities. The encrypted data can only be
converted back into its original format, a process called decryption, with the proper cryptographic key, which
is a string of data used by encryption algorithms to encrypt and decrypt data. Encryption is particularly
effective for safeguarding sensitive information during transmission or storage, making it an important tool
for protecting data privacy and integrity.
The two most common types of encryption are symmetric and asymmetric. With symmetric encryption, the
same key encrypts and decrypts the data. This approach can quickly and easily handle a lot of data all at once.
The tricky part, though, is that both parties need to have the key, and sharing it securely can be challenging. In
asymmetric encryption, also known as public-key cryptography, a public and a private key secure the
connection. This eliminates the need to securely share a key, but it is slower than symmetric encryption. Each
type of encryption serves specific use cases: symmetric is often used for data at rest, and asymmetric for data
in transit. Asymmetric encryption is used in Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), a communication protocol that
establishes a secure connection between devices or applications on a network by encrypting data sent
between a browser and a website or between two servers, and Transport Layer Security (TLS), an updated
version of SSL that uses an encrypted tunnel to protect data sent between a browser, a website, and the
website’s server. TLS prevents unauthorized access to messages and protects against hackers hijacking
connections. The standard symmetric encryption algorithm used globally to secure data, known for its speed
and security, is advanced encryption standard (AES), while RSA encryption is a commonly used asymmetric
cryptographic algorithm used for secure data transmission that is particularly useful in public-key
cryptography.
The mechanism of authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user, application, or device trying
164
5 • Information Systems Security Risk Management
Access for free at openstax.org

to access a network or system, often through credentials such as passwords or digital certificates. This can
range from simple methods such as username and password combinations to more sophisticated techniques
involving multi factor authentication (MFA), which is a security measure that requires users to verify their
identity using multiple forms of credentials, such as a password, a security token, or biometric data, to access
a system. MFA might require something you know (password), something you have (a mobile device for a
token), and something you are (biometrics such as a fingerprint). Proper authentication methods are vital to
ensuring that only authorized personnel have access to sensitive data and systems. However, if mismanaged,
they could also become a massive security risk, such as if someone gained access to your biometric data to
imitate your likeness.
Other key components in network security include firewalls, intrusion detection systems (IDSs), and virtual
private networks. A virtual private network (VPN) is a service that creates a secure, encrypted connection
over a less secure network, typically the internet, ensuring private data remains protected. A firewall is a
network security system that uses security rules to monitor and control incoming and outgoing traffic,
typically between a trusted network and an untrusted entity (such as local area networks or the internet).
Intrusion detection systems (IDSs) are more advanced in their capability, as they use pattern detection.
Firewalls are mostly a preventive measure, whereas IDSs are a detective measure. IDSs can watch network
traffic to detect anomalies that could be a security breach. VPNs, on the other hand, are network
configurations that can supply a secure virtual tunnel for data transmission, often used for establishing secure
remote access to a network. Think of a VPN as a private, secure, virtual tunnel through the internet. This tube
ensures that no one can intercept or access the data during its journey. Similarly, a VPN encrypts your internet
connection, creating a secure tunnel that protects your data from hackers, spies, and other potential threats,
ensuring that your online activities remain private and secure. Together, these technologies form the
foundational layers of a comprehensive network security architecture, each serving a specific role but
collectively contributing to the robustness of the entire system.
Network Vulnerabilities and Threats
Network vulnerabilities and threats are critical issues that impact the security posture of any organization.
Weak configurations, outdated software, and lax security policies often make networks susceptible to a range
of malicious activities. Understanding these vulnerabilities is a fundamental step in fortifying a network’s
defenses.
Types of Network Vulnerabilities
When it comes to network security, software vulnerabilities often serve as an open door for attackers. A
software vulnerability is a weakness or flaw within a software system, particularly in outdated or unpatched
systems, that can be exploited by cybercriminals to gain unauthorized access or to disrupt the software’s
normal functioning. Outdated software and unpatched systems are particularly risky because they may have
known flaws that have not been addressed, making them a target for cybercriminals. Imagine your software
as a building: If everyone knows there is a broken lock on one of the doors, it is only a matter of time before an
unauthorized individual enters. Therefore, keeping software up to date is essential.
Several new vulnerabilities have been introduced into the digital world with the advent of artificial
intelligence (AI), the branch of computer science focused on creating intelligent machines capable of
performing tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition,
decision-making, and language translation. One beneficial use of AI is to generate complex passwords.
However, the technology can also be used in damaging ways. For example, computer-generated voices have
increased robocalls, causing excess cell network traffic, and have been used by attackers to exploit and steal
money from victims in social engineering attacks. Attackers have also used this same technology to crack
passwords through brute-force attacks.
5.1 • The Importance of Network Security
165

LINK TO LEARNING
In early 2024, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) made it illegal for companies to use AI-
generated voices in robocalls. Read their press release related to voice cloning technology
(https://openstax.org/r/109VoiceTech) to learn more about how companies use the technology and why the
FCC has made it illegal.
Software updates not only provide new features and improve system performance, they also often deliver
critical patches that resolve these vulnerabilities. Cybersecurity demands continuous monitoring and control
from a proactive and reactive perspective. Unpatched systems may function normally, which can lead to a false
sense of security. Breaches of such systems can compromise the entire network’s integrity. The risks include
unauthorized data access, identity theft, or even denial of service attacks that can bring business operations to
a halt. By understanding the risks posed by software vulnerabilities, organizations can make educated
decisions about how to protect their network assets effectively.
Hardware Vulnerabilities
Hardware vulnerabilities can be just as dangerous as software vulnerabilities, but they are often overlooked. A
hardware vulnerability is a weakness or flaw within the physical components of a network, such as routers or
IoT devices. For example, unsecured routers and other networking devices can be weak points in an
organization’s cybersecurity defenses. Imagine a router that’s still using the default password or is not
properly configured; it becomes an easy target for cyberattacks. While it may seem trivial, the hardware that
connects your network to the outside world should be as secure as the information it is supporting.
Issues can also arise with IoT devices. These gadgets, such as smart thermostats and smart coffee makers, are
increasingly popular but are not always designed with security in mind. Even in an environment where
computer systems are well protected, these seemingly harmless devices can be weak points for cyber threats.
Without robust security measures, such as strong passwords and regular firmware updates, IoT devices can be
manipulated to spy on an organization or serve as a launch pad for broader network attacks. Recognizing
these hardware vulnerabilities is the first step toward developing a more comprehensive approach to network
security.
Configuration Issues
Poor configuration can be a significant threat to security. Default settings on hardware and software are
especially dangerous because they often turn into easy entry points for cybercriminals. For instance, leaving
administrative credentials at their factory settings can provide an all-access pass into sensitive systems,
compromising the entire network’s integrity. Similarly, poorly configured firewalls can be likened to having a
state-of-the-art lock but leaving the key under the mat. Even advanced intrusion detection systems become
largely ineffective if the firewall rules are not appropriately configured to filter malicious or unnecessary traffic.
Poor configurations can lead to unauthorized access, data leaks, and theft of sensitive information.
Real-world incidents have underscored these risks. In 2017, the WannaCry ransomware attack exploited a
vulnerability that could have been mitigated with proper security configurations.5 The malicious software that
encrypts users’ files such as photos, documents, or other sensitive information and demands a ransom for
their release is called ransomware. The WannaCry ransomware attack exploited a vulnerability in Microsoft
Windows known as “EternalBlue,” which allowed the attack to spread across networks, encrypting files along
the way (Figure 5.4). Microsoft published a fix for the vulnerability; however, many organizations were slow to
make the update, which ultimately resulted in organizations losing billions of dollars. Additionally, numerous
data breaches have occurred due to misconfigured cloud storage solutions, exposing sensitive customer data
to the public.6 These incidents serve as cautionary tales, highlighting the need for mindfulness in system and
network configurations.

Ensuring proper configuration is not just a task for the IT department but requires an organization-wide
commitment to adhering to the best practices in cybersecurity. Properly configured settings are the first line of
defense in a multilayered security approach, and lapses in this area can have catastrophic implications for any
organization.
Types of Network Threats
As we navigate our day-to-day online activities at work, school, or home, there are multiple threats that we
must mitigate for our safety. Threats from natural disasters and storms can disable a network, and threats
from an external attacker can result in loss of operations or theft. Moreover, an internal threat that originates
from within an organization can result in sabotage, data loss, or network compromise. There are three types of
network threats: environmental, external, and internal, as Figure 5.5 illustrates.

Environmental and External Threats
An environmental threat in cybersecurity is an uncontrollable external factor such as a natural disaster or
hardware failure that can damage data centers and disrupt business operations. These threats often get
overshadowed by the dramatic nature of hacker attacks and internal espionage, yet their impact can be
equally catastrophic. For instance, natural disasters such as earthquakes, floods, or hurricanes can severely
damage data centers that host critical information and applications. The inability to access or recover this data
not only interrupts business operations, but can also have legal and reputational ramifications. Moreover, as
these calamities are beyond human control, they are particularly difficult to mitigate. In recent years, the
increasing frequency of extreme weather events attributed to climate change has escalated this environmental
risk, necessitating an urgent review and adaptation of existing disaster recovery and business continuity
plans.7
Another common environmental threat is hardware failure. Servers, storage systems, and networking
equipment can wear out over time. Without proper monitoring and maintenance, these failures can cause
data loss or service interruptions. Unlike natural disasters, hardware failures are often preventable through
regular inspections, timely upgrades, and redundancy systems. Many organizations employ real-time
monitoring tools that alert them to potential hardware issues before they escalate into full-blown failures.
Nonetheless, the commonplace nature of these threats should not lead to complacency; both natural disasters
and hardware failures require strategic planning, investment in robust infrastructure, and ongoing vigilance to
ensure organizational resilience.

An external threat in this context refers to a threat that originates from outside an organization, typically
posed by cybercriminals or state-sponsored attackers who aim to exploit vulnerabilities for financial or
strategic gain. Cybercriminals often appear as resourceful yet malicious actors who continually refine their
tactics to evade detection and maximize their gains. Various methods, such as phishing schemes, malware
deployment, and ransomware attacks, are among their preferred tools. These individuals or groups are not
the only external threats, however; state-sponsored attacks present an even more daunting challenge.
Orchestrated by nations aiming to steal critical information or disrupt infrastructures, these attacks benefit
from considerable resources and advanced capabilities, turning cybersecurity into a complex game of
geopolitics.8
Understanding the techniques of these external threats is necessary for developing effective defensive
measures. For example, a common method used by cybercriminals is social engineering, which involves
manipulating employees into revealing sensitive information, often leading to unauthorized system access. At
the other end of the spectrum, state-sponsored attacks might employ highly sophisticated methods such as
advanced persistent threats (APTs) to gain and maintain long-term access to target networks. These types of
threats can include software such as a rootkit or malware. A rootkit enables attackers to have access to a
system by masquerading as operating system processes, and malware is malicious software designed to
damage, exploit, or infect systems, or otherwise compromise data, devices, users, or networks, using viruses,
worms, and spyware that is installed into the basic input-output system (BIOS) of a computer. While
cybercriminals are motivated primarily by financial gains, state-sponsored actors often have a more complex
agenda, which could include espionage, destabilization, or strategic advantage. This complexity demands a full
understanding, not just of the technological aspects of these threats, but also of the political dimensions that
underlie them.
Internal Threats
An internal threat is one that originates from within an organization, such as disgruntled employees or poor
security training for employees resulting in social engineering attacks. In cybersecurity, internal threats are
particularly tricky because they relate to the risk of someone inside a company using their access to systems to
cause damage or steal data. While organizations spend a lot on protecting their assets from external hackers,
the risks from within can be just as damaging. Disgruntled employees, for instance, already have access to the
organization’s network and thus can bypass one of the organization’s first lines of defense. As the motivations
of such people can range from revenge to financial gain, they function as unpredictable actors within the
cybersecurity landscape. To further complicate matters, insider threats may not even be intentionally
malicious; they could simply be employees who unknowingly compromise security through poor practices,
such as using weak passwords or falling victim to phishing scams.
Understanding the risks from internal threats means thinking beyond just technical fixes. The human factor is
an important factor. Organizations must create a workplace where employees feel comfortable talking about
their concerns. This can help reduce the chances of anyone becoming disgruntled. Simultaneously, companies
must implement robust monitoring systems to identify unusual activity that could signal an internal threat. By
recognizing the multifaceted nature of internal threats, organizations can develop a holistic strategy that
integrates technological, psychological, and administrative measures to safeguard their assets.

prepare for. Quantum computing, a method of computing that uses qubits (a measurement of four states
as opposed to two), with its unparalleled computational speed, has the potential to break existing
encryption algorithms, rendering most current data protection measures obsolete. Initiatives such as post-
quantum cryptography are in the works to counter this impending threat, but widespread adoption and
implementation remain a challenge.
Alternatively, AI-driven cyberattacks are becoming increasingly sophisticated. Advanced machine learning
algorithms can quickly analyze network vulnerabilities and execute complex attacks with little to no human
intervention. Moreover, these algorithms can adapt and learn from each cyberattack, making them more
effective with each iteration. This intensifies the need for cybersecurity measures to evolve in tandem,
incorporating AI-driven threat detection and response systems that can match the capabilities of next-
generation threats. Therefore, staying abreast of these future trends is not just advisable; it is imperative
for long-term security resilience.
5.2 Security Technologies and Solutions
Learning Objectives
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
•
Identify technologies and solutions to protect information and networks
•
Identify potential security threats and vulnerabilities, and choose appropriate countermeasures
•
Describe best practices for secure computing and risk management
•
Determine legal and ethical issues in securing information and networks
As technology continues to advance, protecting digital information and networks has become a top priority for
individuals, organizations, and governments alike. With the rise of increasingly sophisticated cyber threats, it is
essential to understand the tools and strategies available to safeguard sensitive data and critical
infrastructure. Effective security requires not only the right technologies to defend against potential attacks,
but also a solid understanding of how to identify vulnerabilities and implement measures that mitigate risk. In
addition to technical solutions, secure computing practices and thoughtful risk management play a crucial role
in maintaining system integrity. Furthermore, navigating the complex landscape of legal and ethical issues
surrounding information security is vital, as the balance between privacy, compliance, and protection
continues to evolve.
Technologies and Solutions to Protect Information and Networks
In cybersecurity, numerous technologies and solutions stand as defenses against an array of threats that aim
to compromise information and network security. The field of information security risk management (ISRM)
involves identifying, assessing, and mitigating risks to the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of
information and information systems. From foundational measures such as firewalls and encryption protocols
to specialized tools for intrusion detection and risk assessment, the complexities of maintaining a secure
digital environment are wide-ranging. These technologies play critical roles in safeguarding both individual
and organizational digital assets. Furthermore, these technologies can enable ISRM professionals to promote
digital trust, a valuable tool for growth and success of businesses.
Firewalls
Firewalls serve an important role in network security, functioning as the gatekeepers that police the flow of
data coming in and out of a network. Acting as the first line of defense, they are necessary in preventing
potential cyber threats from external sources. The versatility of modern firewalls allows for a comprehensive
approach to managing data flow. Advanced versions meticulously examine the content within a data packet,
which is a small unit of data transmitted over a network, and differentiate various forms of web traffic such as
170
5 • Information Systems Security Risk Management
Access for free at openstax.org

file transfers, browser activity, and applications accessing the internet, thus facilitating the implementation of
nuanced security policies.
For instance, firewalls can authorize access to applications that have undergone rigorous vetting processes
and are deemed safe while promptly blocking others that pose a potential security risk. These applications
vary, ranging from video games seeking updates to activity in the background while browsing the internet.
Types of Firewalls
There are several types of firewalls, each with a distinct set of features and functionalities, but they are broadly
categorized into hardware and software firewalls. The most basic type of firewall is a packet filtering firewall,
which checks the header of packets as they pass through, looking for specific characteristics such as source
and destination address, port number, and protocol used. They are usually software based, and they operate
by examining packets of data to determine whether to allow them through based on preset rules.
A more advanced type of firewall is a stateful inspection firewall, which monitors active connections and uses
that context to block or allow connections. These types of firewalls may be software or hardware based. A next-
generation firewall (NGFW) is an advanced type of firewall that provides more comprehensive security features
than traditional packet filtering and stateful inspection and uses a proactive approach to network security.
These firewalls come equipped with integrated intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDPSs), offering an
additional layer of security. These IDPS functionalities are engineered to actively scan for, identify, and
neutralize known threats as they occur.
A proxy firewall is a network security device that filters incoming and outgoing traffic by acting as an
intermediary between users and the web. It is software based and provides an additional layer of isolation and
security.
Firewall Implementation Challenges
Firewalls are essential for network security, which is the process of guarding network infrastructure and IT
systems from unauthorized access, misuse, malfunction, or improper disclosure to unintended parties. It
involves using a variety of tools, technologies, and policies to ensure the safety and security of data traveling
over the network. Configuring detailed security policies can get complicated, and there is a risk of false
positives in intrusion detection. Plus, firewalls need regular updates to handle new threats, so they require
ongoing maintenance. Despite these challenges, firewalls are an important part of any solid network security
plan. To boost cybersecurity, it is smart to have backup plans in place. This also goes for hardware. Using two
different firewalls from two different providers can add extra layers of protection and reliability.
Protocols
A protocol is a fundamental rule or procedure that governs communication between devices in a network.
Protocols ensure that data are transmitted accurately, reliably, and securely by defining how data are
packaged, transmitted, and received. Protocols operate at various layers of the network stack, addressing
different aspects of communication. By standardizing communication processes, protocols enable
interoperability between different systems and devices, making seamless and efficient digital communication
possible. Think of them as rules that computers must obey, like how drivers must obey traffic laws. Common
protocols include HTTP, HTTPS, VPN, and S/MIME.
Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) and its secure alternative HTTP secure (HTTPS) form the foundation of web
communications (Table 5.2). Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is proficient at transmitting hypertext over
the internet, and Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) adds a secure, encrypted layer to HTTP via
SSL/TLS protocols. To understand how HTTP works, imagine that you make a request for a web page through a
browser. This happens when you click on a link or enter an address in the search bar of your browser, initiating
an HTTP request. This request is sent to a web server, which then responds by supplying the requested
information in the form of hypertext. This hypertext is what your browser interprets and displays as a web

page. The process is remarkably fast, enabling standardized and consistent viewing of websites across
different browsers. Encrypting a connection ensures that the data in transit is secure. For ISRM professionals,
understanding the importance of HTTPS over HTTP is essential, especially when dealing with sensitive
information.

Table 5.2 Comparing HTTP and HTTPS HTTPS provides much more security, whereas HTTP provides little to no protection.
Virtual private networks (VPNs) serve as a proxy for internet communication by establishing a private
encrypted connection or tunnel that makes it difficult for attackers to breach. Various protocols such as Point-
to-Point Tunneling Protocol (PPTP), Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol (L2TP), and OpenVPN are used for different
security and speed requirements. PPTP is fast but less secure, whereas OpenVPN offers a balance of speed
and security. L2TP usually operates with IPsec for added security.
A Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail Extension (S/MIME) is a standard for public key encryption and signing of
MIME data. It is frequently used for securing email messages. S/MIME allows for cryptographic security
services such as authentication and message integrity checks, ensuring that both the sender and the
information remain uncompromised.
Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems
In network security, an intrusion detection and prevention system (IDPS) monitors networks for malicious
activity or policy violations. This is vital for keeping information secure. Think of protocols as a set of rules that
allow machines to communicate smoothly. IDPSs, on the other hand, are specialized hardware and software
tools that monitor network traffic to detect and prevent security breaches. These systems come in various
forms and can be deployed in different ways to best protect against potential threats. By actively monitoring
communications, IDPSs help prevent security incidents before they can cause harm. Signature-based IDPSs are
designed to detect known threats by searching for specific patterns, such as malware signatures. Anomaly-
based systems, on the other hand, focus on identifying abnormal patterns in data flow or behavior that might
signify a security threat. Both have their own advantages and limitations; signature-based systems are highly
effective against known threats but can miss new, previously unseen threats, while anomaly-based systems
can detect novel threats but are prone to false positives.
Network-based IDPSs are used to monitor and analyze network traffic to protect an entire network from
threats, whereas host-based systems are installed on individual devices and protect against unauthorized data
manipulation or software vulnerabilities specific to those devices. These systems often rely on signature-based
detection methods along with anomaly-based methods that look for unusual patterns in network traffic that
could be harmful.

Monitoring Tools
The foundation of an effective information security strategy begins with simple and effective monitoring tools,
such as log files, alarms, and keyloggers. Although these measures might appear basic, their importance
cannot be overstated, especially when it comes to instilling a sense of digital trust.
A log file is a file generated by security applications that contains event information that aids in determining
the status and health of a network. These are invaluable for diagnostics, troubleshooting, and security audits.
An alarm is a protection device often installed on equipment to notify staff in the event of tampering or
breach. It serves as a real-time alert system that notifies administrators of potential security threats. These are
usually triggered by predefined conditions set within the IDPS or other security software. A keylogger is a tool
or technology often used maliciously to capture keystrokes on a computer to obtain sensitive information such
as passwords. Although they are often associated with malicious activities, legitimate versions exist for
monitoring and auditing purposes. However, these tools must be managed carefully to ensure they do not
compromise the very security they are meant to uphold.
In addition, the following tools are also used for monitoring network security:
•
A packet sniffer, also known as a network analyzer or protocol analyzer, is a tool that captures and
analyzes network traffic. It intercepts data packets flowing across a network, allowing for examination of
the data within these packets, including their source, destination, and content. Packet sniffers can capture
data packets in “promiscuous mode,” meaning they can see all traffic on the network, not just traffic
intended for the sniffing device. For example, Wireshark is a popular open-source packet analyzer that
allows capture and analysis of network traffic.
•
A protocol analyzer is a tool that examines network communication protocols to understand how data
are exchanged between devices and applications on a network. Protocol analyzers capture and analyze
data packets, decode them based on the protocol used, and provide insights into the communication
process. They can identify errors, performance bottlenecks, and security vulnerabilities related to specific
protocols. Protocol analyzers and packet sniffers are often used interchangeably, as they both involve
capturing and analyzing network traffic. However, protocol analyzers focus more on understanding the
communication protocols and analyzing the data within the context of those protocols.
•
A security information and event management (SIEM) system is a security solution that collects,
analyzes, and correlates security data from different sources to detect and respond to security threats in
real time. SIEM systems gather logs, events, and alerts from various security tools and network devices,
and then use advanced analytics to identify suspicious activity, potential vulnerabilities, and security
incidents. SIEM helps organizations improve threat detection, incident response, security compliance, and
overall security posture.
Best Practices for Network Threat Mitigation
In the complex domain of information security, best practices serve as guiding principles that are universally
applicable across various sectors and organizational structures. They are the reliable methods that provide
consistent security outcomes and contribute to the establishment of digital trust. Best practices in the
information security field include the following:
•
multi factor authentication (MFA), which adds an additional layer, or layers, of security, ensuring that even
if one factor is compromised, unauthorized access is still restricted
•
regular updates and patch management, the routine process of updating software to address security
vulnerabilities, are ongoing, proactive measures that attempt to close the gap through which
cyberattackers can infiltrate systems
•
zero trust, or “never trust, always verify,” a cybersecurity model where access to resources is granted
based on strict verification and continuous authentication, rather than assuming trust based on network
location or device ownership
5.2 • Security Technologies and Solutions
173

•
defense in depth, a cybersecurity strategy that employs multiple layers of security controls to protect
against attacks, so that if one layer fails, others will still be in place to prevent a breach
•
vendor diversity, the practice of using multiple vendors for different security products and services instead
of relying on a single vendor to mitigate risks associated with vendor lock-in, reduce security
vulnerabilities, and improve overall security posture
•
security training and awareness programs, which educate employees about the importance of information
security, the role they play in safeguarding organizational assets, and how to recognize phishing attempts,
maintain password integrity, and ensure secure data transmission
The human element is often regarded as the weakest link in the security chain. By adopting these best
practices, information security and risk management professionals not only enhance an organization’s
resilience against internal and external cyber threats, they also contribute positively to building digital trust,
thereby enabling business to grow and thrive in an increasingly interconnected world.
Security Threats, Vulnerabilities, and Appropriate Countermeasures
Security threats and vulnerabilities are constantly changing, posing an ongoing challenge for organizations
and individuals alike. As the IoT, machine learning algorithms, and other technologies integrate deeper into
our lives, they offer an attack surface for malicious actors. The stakes are not just financial or operational; they
traverse digital trust, which is a confidence in the ability of processes, technology, and organizations to create
a secure digital world. Digital trust is a valuable notion that protects organizational branding and confidence.
When digital trust is compromised, it significantly impacts the organization and its stakeholders, including
customers, partners, and regulators.
For example, in 2024, New Hampshire voters filed a lawsuit against the creators of a deepfake robocall that
used AI to generate a fake audio message of former president Joe Biden asking voters to stay home and not
go to the voting booths or poll stations.9 Conceptually, such deepfake scams typically involve creating realistic
audio or video imitations of trusted figures to deceive individuals into taking unauthorized actions. When
these scams are uncovered, consumers lose their digital trust in the organization that created them. People
are naturally protective of their assets, valuables, and identity, all of which they perceive as threatened when
they see an organization misusing digital assets. Through a detailed understanding and implementation of
security mechanisms, individuals and organizations can defend against threats and build resilient systems that
adapt to new challenges as they arise.
Types of Threats
As the internet has gathered more users over the last few decades, cyberattacks have significantly increased.
These attacks vary greatly, consisting of password attacks, phishing attempts, Trojan viruses, malware, and
ransomware that holds users’ sensitive files hostage for ransom payment. Understanding these attacks and
how to prevent them is key to information security.
As the most fundamental of access controls, passwords are a frequent target of malicious actors. Two primary
types of password attacks exploit weaknesses in password security: brute-force attacks and dictionary attacks.
In a brute-force attack, an attacker systematically checks all password or encryption key possibilities until the
correct one is found. In contrast, a dictionary attack uses a precompiled list of likely passwords. Imagine
trying to crack a padlock with four digits, each ranging from 0 to 9. If you don’t have any hints, you’d have to
try every possible combination, which adds up to 10,000 different permutations (104), which is a lot of
guessing.
Now, consider a dictionary attack. Instead of trying every single combination, a dictionary attack gives you a
list of likely combinations based on common patterns or known sequences. This way, you might find the

correct code faster. To guard against both types of attacks, organizations implement stringent password
policies that encourage complex combinations, and they use MFA.
Phishing attacks aim to trick individuals into revealing sensitive information. The attacker often masquerades
as a trustworthy entity, employing emails or messages (Figure 5.6) that prompt users to enter passwords or
other confidential data. Implementing robust email filtering technology and educating users about the
elements of phishing schemes are critical components of a well-rounded defense strategy.
Figure 5.6 Many phishing attempts will appear to originate from a trusted source. However, on careful inspection, one can notice
several discrepancies that discredit the attempt. (attribution: Copyright Rice University, OpenStax, under CC BY 4.0 license)
By weaving these basic security measures into an integrated strategy, ISRM professionals can better arm
organizations against a range of threats. Simple security measures serve both as a first line of defense and as
foundational elements that support more complex security protocols. This layered approach to security helps
maintain digital trust, fostering an environment where businesses can operate with greater confidence in the
digital realm.
Among the most frequently encountered security threats are malware variants such as viruses, worms, and
Trojans (Figure 5.7). A virus attaches itself to clean files and propagates to other files and programs. A worm is
a stand-alone software program that spreads without requiring a host program. A Trojan is a program that
conceals itself as a safe program but often carries many other different types of malicious payloads.
5.2 • Security Technologies and Solutions
175

Figure 5.7 While not an exhaustive list of malware, these are the most common types. (attribution: Copyright Rice University,
OpenStax, under CC BY 4.0 license)
Malware such as Trojan horses and ransomware represent more sophisticated external threats. Trojans trick
users into willingly downloading malicious software that is often disguised as a legitimate program. The
software provides attackers unauthorized access to systems. Advanced endpoint security solutions coupled
with regular updates and patches can offer significant protection against these types of malware.
In recent years, more insidious forms of malware such as fileless malware have emerged. Unlike traditional
malware, which relies on files stored on the hard disk, fileless malware exploits in-memory processes to
conduct its nefarious activities. By leveraging legitimate system tools such as PowerShell or Windows
Management Instrumentation, fileless malware conducts operations entirely within the device's random
access memory (RAM), leaving little to no footprint on the hard disk. This makes it significantly more
challenging for traditional antivirus solutions to detect and eliminate. For a better understanding of how
fileless malware works, look at how Figure 5.8 follows a user’s click in a spam email.

In contrast to software-based threats, which target vulnerabilities in computer systems, social engineering
attacks such as phishing and pretexting leverage human vulnerabilities. A social engineering attack includes
deceptive tactics used to manipulate individuals into divulging confidential information, exemplified by
phishing and pretexting. Phishing usually involves sending deceptive emails to trick employees into revealing
sensitive information. On the other hand, pretexting involves creating a fabricated scenario to obtain private
data. Despite the sophistication of technical countermeasures, the human factor remains a vulnerability,
making these types of attacks especially harmful to the establishment of digital trust.
An insider threat is a risk posed by individuals within an organization who have access to sensitive information
and systems; they warrant special attention because employees or contractors with insider information can
perpetrate or facilitate attacks that may bypass conventional security measures. This “inside advantage” makes
the threat more complex, as mitigating such threats requires a blend of technical controls and organizational
policies.10 Some of these policies include actions such as mandatory vacations to prevent fraud, role-based
access controls that limit employee access to sensitive information, security awareness training, and regular
audits.
A distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) is an attack that uses multiple computers or servers to overwhelm a
network, resulting in loss of usability. These pose a unique threat: unlike other attacks that seek to gain
unauthorized access or retrieve sensitive information, DDoS attacks aim to incapacitate the target’s
operations. The immediate impact is not just operational disruption, but also a severe degradation of digital
trust among stakeholders.
Vulnerabilities
One of the most well-known software vulnerabilities is the buffer overflow, a condition where an application
writes more data to a buffer than it can hold. This results in data corruption and could allow an attacker to
execute arbitrary code. Another common vulnerability is Structured Query Language (SQL) injection, which
occurs when attackers insert or manipulate SQL queries in an input field, allowing them to gain unauthorized
access to a database. This kind of attack can lead to data leaks, loss of data integrity, and other security issues.
Attacks on firmware (hardware) are increasingly prevalent. These are more difficult to detect as they target the
device at the BIOS or firmware level. This also makes it harder to remove the malware once in the system.
Physical tampering, while straightforward, is another hardware vulnerability. Unauthorized physical access to
hardware can result in the installation of keyloggers or data extraction.

Although cyber threats often originate from the application of sophisticated hacking techniques, it is not
uncommon that the root cause of a breach can be traced back to a simple configuration error. The T-Mobile
data breach of 2023, where a third of its customer base had private information exposed, shows what can
occur when application programming interface (API) configurations are not sufficiently secured.11 An API is a
set of protocols, tools, and definitions that enable different software applications to communicate and interact
with each other, allowing for the exchange of data and functionality. In this breach, insecure APIs allowed
threat actors to access sensitive customer data, impacting not just the affected individuals, but also T-Mobile’s
reputation. As more companies transition their services to the cloud, the risk posed by insecure API
configurations is escalating.
Countermeasures for Threats
Countermeasures to mitigate cybersecurity threats involve a diverse set of tools and approaches. They often
need to be tailored to the specific types of threats and vulnerabilities that an organization faces, but some
universally applicable solutions have proven effective across multiple sectors.

Antivirus and anti-malware software: The most basic but critical line of defense is antivirus and anti-
malware software. These programs provide real-time protection against known threats and offer heuristic
analysis to detect previously unknown forms of malware.
•
Employee training and awareness: Human error remains one of the most significant vulnerabilities in any
organization. Phishing simulations and awareness training can drastically reduce the likelihood of an
employee inadvertently compromising security. A 2024 study has shown that a combination of phishing
awareness programs and phishing testing programs can significantly reduce the click-through rate on
phishing emails.12
•
Intrusion detection systems: An intrusion detection and prevention system is vital to monitoring network
behavior for unusual or suspicious activity.
•
Access control policies: One method of access control, role-based access control (RBAC), bases data
access on a person’s role in the organization, giving each employee the minimum level of access they need
to perform their job functions. This requires an organization to maintain a complete list of data elements
combined with a list of viewable roles and attributes. For example, a health-care organization can
successfully thwart an internal threat by limiting access to patient records to only those employees who
require it for their job duties. Given the complexity and ever-evolving nature of cyber threats, these
countermeasures serve as foundational elements in the continuous effort to uphold digital trust.
•
Regular software patching: One of the most effective ways to mitigate vulnerabilities is through timely
software patching. In 2017, the WannaCry ransomware attack exploited a vulnerability in older Windows
systems. Microsoft had issued a patch months before, but because many organizations had not updated
their systems, this led to widespread damage.13
•
Physical security measures: Physical intrusion can bypass the most sophisticated digital security measures.
One type of social engineering known as tailgating is a good example of this. Tailgating is the act of
following someone very closely as they enter a secured building. This enables the attacker to enter the
facility without having to use credentials such as an ID badge. Once inside, the attacker has access to
critical infrastructure and can cause a data breach or other damage. Strict controls such as mantraps,
which prevent more than one person from entering a facility simultaneously, help to mitigate this threat.
Additional Practices for Secure Computing and Risk Management
Cybersecurity threats are always changing, and vulnerabilities can pop up when least expected. That is why

prevention should be the cornerstone of any threat mitigation strategy. Organizations need to tackle cyber
threats with proactive strategies, using secure computing and risk management practices that are both
thorough and flexible.
Ethical Hacking
The process of attempting to break into an organization’s computer systems, network, or applications with
permission to identify vulnerabilities is called ethical hacking. It has gained considerable attention as a much-
needed practice within the cybersecurity field. While the goals of ethical hackers align with those of
cybersecurity experts in identifying vulnerabilities, the methods employed can resemble those of malicious
hackers. This raises questions regarding the ethical and legal boundaries that distinguish ethical hacking from
unauthorized, illegal activities.
The concept of consent is fundamental in ethical hacking. Unlike malicious actors, ethical hackers operate with
explicit permission from the organization that owns the system. This consent is often given under a legal
contract that outlines the extent of the testing, the systems that can be assessed, and the methods that can be
used. Consent provides the ethical and legal basis for the hacking activities, turning what could otherwise be
considered an illegal breach into an accepted practice.
One example that illustrates the gray area in ethical hacking is a 2019 case involving a cybersecurity firm. Two
of its ethical hackers were arrested in Iowa while conducting a physical security assessment of a courthouse.
Despite their having a contract that permitted them to perform physical intrusion testing, the authorities
arrested them, and the hackers faced criminal charges. This was particularly surprising because the
cybersecurity company had been hired by Iowa’s judicial branch to conduct the assessment.14
This incident highlighted the potential ambiguity and legal risks involved in ethical hacking, even when it’s
conducted under a contract. It sparked an extensive debate in the cybersecurity community about the legal
safeguards needed for ethical hackers. The charges against the two ethical hackers were eventually dropped,
but not without the individuals and the firm suffering reputational damage. The case became a watershed
moment for ethical hacking, urging the community, lawmakers, and organizations to be more explicit in
contracts and to establish clearer legal guidelines.
This case serves as reminder that ethical hacking is a field still very much in the process of defining its legal
and ethical contours. There is a clear need for explicit and transparent guidelines for ethical hackers and
legislators, and they need to maintain an ongoing dialogue to build a more robust legal framework.
CAREERS IN IS
The Role of Ethical Hackers
Ethical hackers are security professionals with specialized training in simulating cyberattacks under
controlled conditions. Their role is to systematically assess the security posture of an organization by
conducting targeted tests first to identify and then to exploit vulnerabilities in software, hardware, and
operational procedures. They conduct penetration testing that simulates real attacks by scanning systems,
then attempting to breach them, and then determining how deep they can get into the system. Ethical
hackers can also perform security audits and assessments and report the results of their penetration
testing and audits to the organization with recommendations for improving the security. An organization
may also hire an ethical hacker for continuous monitoring. Their work must fall within all laws and
standards, following guidelines from the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) or standards from
the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). All ethical hackers must have authorization from
the organization, maintain integrity of the system and data, and maintain confidentiality when handling

data.
Risk Management Approaches
Risk assessments are important for identifying vulnerabilities and determining how they impact organizational
objectives. These assessments can be either quantitative or qualitative in nature (Table 5.3).
Qualitative Risk Assessment
Quantitative Risk Assessment
Uses subjective criteria such as expert opinions and
likelihood scales
Uses numerical data and statistical methods
Uses data from interviews and observations
Uses measurable data such as historical records
and figures
Usually returns more descriptive insights
Information returned is generally descriptive in
nature
Requires less in terms of tools for analysis
Normally requires more resources and analysis
tools
Suited best for situations where exact data are not
available
Preferred for risks that can be accurately
measured
Table 5.3 Comparison of Qualitative and Quantitative Risk Assessments Qualitative assessments are subjective, whereas
quantitative assessments are objective.
Before organizations can assess risks, they should try to determine two factors: their appetite for it and their
level of tolerance. A risk appetite refers to the level of risk an organization is willing to accept in pursuit of its
ambitions or goals and is more qualitative in nature. It is a strategic outlook set by top management and
influences how resources for security measures are allocated. Unlike risk appetite, risk tolerance is the
number of unfavorable outcomes an organization is willing to accept while pursuing goals and other
objectives. It is more operational and quantitative than risk appetite, using statistical probability to identify
potential risk outcomes. It defines the boundaries of risk variations that are acceptable during the execution of
specific projects or processes. In a cybersecurity setting, addressing risk tolerance could include prioritization
strategies on how resources are allocated on a network, the network credentials of employees, and budget
allocation for IT management. One example of this is a company that allows their ethical hackers to monitor
malicious and dangerous sites to identify potential threats. While this is a proactive approach to identifying
new threats, monitoring outside threats does not come with the same explicit permission an ethical hacker
would have to penetrate the organization’s systems. The hacker would need to be especially careful not to
violate the site’s terms of service or acceptable use policies.
Frameworks for Risk Management
In the world of information security, frameworks play a very important role in managing and controlling risks.
A framework is a structured set of guidelines and best practices that help an organization to implement,
manage, and maintain security protocols. There are many frameworks to guide risk management practices.
One recognized model is NIST’s Cybersecurity Framework. The NIST framework is widely adopted due to its
user-friendly nature and applicability across many sectors. Moreover, it aligns well with other standards and is
scalable to the size of the industry. The NIST framework is divided into five core functions (Figure 5.9).

The NIST framework provides a flexible and cost-effective approach to improving cybersecurity across
industries. It is designed to be adaptable to organizations of all sizes and is widely used to strengthen cyber
defenses.
Building a Culture of Security
As you’ve learned, human error or negligence often poses a significant information security risk.
Implementing technical solutions is only part of the equation; the other part lies in fostering a strong security
culture within an organization. Training programs and regular awareness sessions can provide employees with
the necessary skills and knowledge they need to serve as the organization’s first line of defense. Training can
help them recognize phishing attempts, use strong passwords, and follow security best practices. Educating
staff on proper behavior is key to reducing the risk of human error and preventing security breaches.
Legal and Ethical Issues in Securing Information and Networks
Compliance with laws and regulations is a required aspect of cybersecurity. These regulations not only protect
the digital privacy of citizens, but also provide a mechanism of action for those whose rights are violated.
Some examples of regulations are the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which impacts data storage
and sharing practices within the EU, and the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS), which
lays out regulations for organizations that handle credit card transactions. As new threats emerge, regulations
like these can change frequently, especially as attackers gain access to new technologies and attack methods.
Being caught not complying with regulations can lead to heavy penalties or even legal action. Thus, regular
updates and audits are vital in ensuring continuous compliance with current regulations.
Understanding the relationship between legal frameworks and ethical considerations is critical for legal
compliance and maintaining stakeholder trust and safeguarding organizational reputation. With the
expansion of digital technologies into every aspect of daily life, compliance with legal and ethical norms and
guidelines becomes not just advisable but essential. Not adhering properly to such norms or guidelines can
result in severe ramifications, ranging from legal penalties to a loss of customer trust. Moreover,
noncompliance can irreparably harm an organization’s standing in the global market.
Legal Protections Afforded to Employees and Users
There are legal guidelines in place that affect every stakeholder in an organization to protect them from harm.
5.2 • Security Technologies and Solutions
181

Understanding these protections is essential for organizations to protect their users, human capital, and
assets. Increasingly, employees who report cybersecurity lapses are protected by whistleblower laws. This
protection introduces an additional layer of legal complexity for organizations. Disciplinary actions against
employees who report cybersecurity issues can lead to legal repercussions, such as lawsuits and regulatory
action. One way to avoid such situations is to emphasize the need for a robust internal reporting and response
mechanism.
User Agreements and Legal Recourse
End-user license agreements (EULAs) and terms of service (ToS) often contain clauses related to data security
and privacy. However, these agreements are coming under increasing scrutiny for being “contracts of
adhesion,” giving consumers little negotiating power. In the context of cybersecurity, these agreements
frequently encompass clauses specifically related to data security and privacy, outlining the responsibilities of
service providers in protecting user data and detailing the measures taken to prevent data breaches and
cyberattacks.
As cybersecurity incidents become more prevalent, courts are beginning to scrutinize these agreements more
closely, particularly assessing whether they provide adequate protection to users against cybersecurity threats.
This shift in legal perspective is significant as it could lead to more stringent requirements for cybersecurity
measures in user agreements, offering enhanced legal recourse to consumers in cases of lax cybersecurity
practices. The evolving legal landscape around EULAs and ToS underscores the need for robust cybersecurity
measures and fair user agreements to maintain digital trust and legal compliance.
Regional Laws, Intellectual Property Rights, and Consequences
Regional laws and their implications can serve as critical indicators of how various jurisdictions respond to the
challenges posed by cybersecurity and data protection. In the United States, for instance, the California
Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) serves as a legislative example that is often considered to be the most stringent
data protection law in the country. Not only does it allow Californians to understand what personal data are
being collected about them, it also gives them the ability to deny the sale of their data.15
One of the most challenging aspects of cybersecurity law is the notion of jurisdiction in cyberspace. An
organization based in one country may store data or have data centers in another. This poses questions about
which laws apply and how they can be enforced. For instance, a European company with U.S.-based clients will
need to consider both GDPR and any relevant U.S. laws.
Navigating jurisdictional conflicts can be quite complex for organizations. To handle these challenges
effectively, it is essential to have a solid grasp of international law as it applies to cyberspace. This knowledge is
becoming increasingly important as businesses expand globally, each country bringing its own set of
regulations and requirements. Staying current with these diverse legal landscapes is not just good practice, it
is necessary for maintaining compliance and ethical standards in today’s digital world. GPDR and laws like it
have had a major impact on how companies respond to takedown requests for data and how they protect data
in storage and transit. Failure to comply with these regulations has resulted in substantial fines.

software code, databases, and even certain types of algorithms, beyond the more traditional forms of media
such as text, images, and music.
Copyright infringement in the digital age has developed into an important topic due to the ease of data
replication and dissemination. Whether it is pirated software, illegal downloading of copyrighted music or
movies, or unauthorized distribution of proprietary information, infringement can have a significant financial
impact for an organization that relies heavily on copyrighted material for their business operations. They can
lose substantial revenue, which could, in turn, affect their ability to innovate and compete. The legal
consequences for infringement can range from fines to imprisonment.
Moreover, copyright infringement can result in a cascade of legal disputes that may involve multiple
jurisdictions, especially if the data are stored or transmitted across borders. This complexity can strain
resources as companies are forced to engage in lengthy and costly legal battles. For cybersecurity
professionals, understanding the subtleties of copyright laws and their enforcement mechanisms is essential
not just for risk mitigation, but also for ensuring ethical conduct in an organization’s digital operations. This
underscores the need for a robust copyright protection strategy as a part of an organization’s overall
cybersecurity posture.
In addition to copyright infringement, organizations face substantial legal consequences for failing to protect
intellectual property (IP). Laws protecting intellectual property, such as patents, copyrights, and trade secrets,
can be leveraged to file lawsuits against organizations that fail to protect these assets adequately. The legal
ramifications can include both civil and criminal penalties, such as fines and, in extreme cases, imprisonment
for key decision-makers within the organization.
Gaining unlawful access to computer systems can lead to criminal charges, often categorized under statutes
like the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA) in the United States. Such charges can result in imprisonment
and hefty fines for individuals. The key element in such cases is the concept of “unauthorized access,” which
covers activities ranging from hacking into networks to merely exceeding the limits of authorized access.
ETHICS IN IS
Digital Privacy and Law Enforcement
A notable case that underscores the ethical dilemma faced by law enforcement regarding information
security involves the FBI’s handling of the iPhone belonging to one of the terrorists involved a December
2015 shooting in San Bernardino, CA. The FBI secured a court order requiring Apple to create a software
bypass to the phone’s encryption. Apple resisted,16 sparking a national debate over the ethics of privacy
and security. After Apple’s refusal to create a bypass for the shooter’s six-digit pin, the FBI found a small
Australian company that had created an effective iPhone hacking tool that allowed them to break into the
phone.17 Although this meant that Apple was able to avoid creating a potentially dangerous tool that could
compromise the safety and privacy of all Apple customers, there was one that already existed. The FBI was
able to use this tool to work around the legal fight, but it did not resolve the ethical battle. The core of that
ethical dilemma rested in balancing the need for national security and the investigation of a terrorist act
against the protection of privacy rights and the potential implications of creating a vulnerability that could
be exploited by others.

5.3 Information Security and Risk Management Strategies
Learning Objectives
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
•
Identify the key components and principles of an effective ISRM strategy
•
Describe various compliance frameworks and regulations related to information security and risk
management and how they are used
•
Develop a comprehensive risk management plan
•
Determine the importance of continuous monitoring and improvement of the ISRM strategy
It is essential for today’s organizations to have a well-crafted information security and risk management (ISRM)
strategy, which is a structured approach to managing an organization’s security processes, tools, and policies
to mitigate risk. Organizations may be attracted to the capabilities of emerging technologies, but they must
also recognize that it is imperative for them to safeguard their physical and digital assets. Not only does a well-
structured ISRM strategy protect against data breaches and cyberattacks, it also serves as a mechanism for
managing the organization’s overall risk exposure.
Key Objectives, Principles, and Components of ISRM Strategy
ISRM does not merely involve deploying the latest security technologies or adhering to compliance
regulations, although these are important. Its primary purpose is to develop a composed set of practices to
protect an organization’s informational assets and data infrastructure. A robust ISRM strategy aims to achieve
three fundamental objectives: to safeguard organizational assets, to prevent data breaches and cyberattacks,
and to reduce overall risk exposure. These objectives are embedded into the core components and principles
that define the ideal ISRM strategy.
With cybercriminals employing increasingly sophisticated techniques, from social engineering to advanced
malware, the need for proactive cyber defense mechanisms has also been increasing. These mechanisms
should ideally include, but not be limited to, network monitoring, penetration testing, and employee training
on cybersecurity best practices. A proactive approach can significantly reduce the probability of a successful
attack, thereby preserving stakeholder trust and ensuring data integrity.
Another objective of ISRM is to reduce an organization’s overall risk exposure. This involves not only
implementing technological solutions, but also facilitating a cultural shift within the organization toward
prioritizing cybersecurity. By conducting regular risk assessments, adopting a layered security approach, and
encouraging a culture of cybersecurity awareness, organizations can significantly mitigate the risks they face.
In doing so, organizations can protect their assets while simultaneously positioning themselves favorably in a
competitive market where consumers and clients are becoming increasingly savvy about data security. To
establish and maintain an effective ISRM strategy, several core components must be diligently addressed and
continually refined. These include risk assessment, policy development, control implementation, training and
awareness, monitoring and auditing, and response and recovery.
Risk Assessment
Risk assessment involves identifying potential threats and vulnerabilities, and the impact they could have on
an organization’s assets. It requires a thorough understanding of the organization’s infrastructure, data, and
business processes. By employing methodologies such as threat modeling and vulnerability assessments,
organizations can prioritize risks based on their likelihood and potential impact, enabling them to allocate
resources more effectively.
Policy Development
Policy development follows risk assessment as a critical step in articulating the organization’s stance on
various security issues. Policies provide a formal set of guidelines that dictate how assets should be protected
184
5 • Information Systems Security Risk Management
Access for free at openstax.org

and how security incidents should be managed. These policies should be clear, concise, and easily
understandable, ensuring that all stakeholders, from the CEO to the newest employee, are on the same page
regarding security expectations and responsibilities. Additionally, IT managers should ensure that the
organization maintains adequate documentation such as acknowledgment forms and training records to track
employee training.
Control Implementation
Control implementation involves putting into place the necessary safeguards to mitigate identified risks. These
controls can be administrative (policies and procedures), technical (such as firewalls and encryption), or
physical (like security cameras and access controls). The key is to establish a balanced mix of these controls to
create a multilayered security environment. Control effectiveness should also be regularly reviewed to ensure
they are performing as intended.
Training and Awareness
Training and awareness programs are essential for cultivating a culture of security within an organization.
Employees are often the first line of defense against cyber threats, so it is vital that they are equipped with the
knowledge and tools they need to recognize and respond to potential security incidents. Regular training
sessions, coupled with awareness campaigns, can significantly reduce the risk of human error, which is a
leading cause of data breaches.
Monitoring and Auditing
Monitoring and auditing are crucial for maintaining visibility over the organization’s security posture.
Continuous monitoring of network traffic, user activities, and system configurations ensures that any
anomalous behavior can be detected and addressed promptly. Auditing provides a retrospective analysis,
helping to uncover security lapses and ensure compliance with relevant laws and policies.
Response and Recovery
Finally, response and recovery involve being prepared to act when a security incident occurs. An organization
should have in place a plan for incident response, which is a predetermined set of procedures and steps
taken to identify, investigate, and respond to a potential security incident. After identifying the breach, an
organization should have procedures for containing the threat, eradicating the malicious elements, and
recovering any lost data. Post-incident analysis is also important, as it provides insights that can be used to
strengthen the organization’s defenses against future attacks.
By effectively addressing these core components, organizations can build a resilient ISRM strategy that can
protect their assets, maintain stakeholder trust, and ensure the continuity of their operations. Each
component is important, and only when they are seamlessly integrated can an organization truly safeguard
itself in the digital age.
Compliance Frameworks and Regulations Related to ISRM
In the context of ISRM, a compliance framework is a set of guidelines and best practices designed to help an
organization comply with legal, regulatory, and technical standards. It serves as the foundation of secure and
resilient organizational practices. These frameworks provide a structured set of guidelines and best practices
that are designed to aid organizations in safeguarding their digital assets and ensuring their adherence to the
CIA triad. Additionally, these frameworks help to establish a foundation for security practices, aligning
organizational processes with industry standards and thus ensuring legal and regulatory compliance.
For organizations aiming to support their security posture and maintain the trust of their stakeholders,
adhering to regulations not only mitigates the risk of legal repercussions, but also fosters a culture of
continuous improvement and due diligence in security practices.
Table 5.4 shows some of the frameworks that are often used to provide guidance for stakeholders as they seek

Table 5.4 Common Frameworks Used in ISRM An organization may use multiple frameworks in developing a robust ISRM strategy.
ISO/IEC 27001
ISO/IEC 27001 is a globally recognized standard for the establishment and certification of an information
security management system (ISMS), a framework that helps organizations manage their information
security by defining policies, procedures, and controls. Developed by the International Organization for
Standardization (ISO), ISO/IEC 27001 sets out the criteria for assessing and treating information security risks
tailored to the needs of the organization. The standard encompasses both the technical and organizational
aspects of information security, ensuring an integrated approach.
The significance of ISO/IEC 27001 lies in its universal applicability across industries and organizations of any
size. It provides a robust framework that helps organizations secure their information assets, enhance their
resilience against cyber threats, and establish trust with stakeholders. By achieving certification, organizations
demonstrate their commitment to information security, which can lead to competitive advantages, improved
client relationships, and compliance with legal and regulatory requirements.
The ISO/IEC 27001 standard is structured into ten main clauses, with the last six dedicated to the ISMS
requirements:18
1.
Scope: Defines the boundaries and applicability of the ISMS
2.
Normative references: Lists the standards referenced in ISO 27001

Although not one of the clauses, guidance on implementing specific controls is discussed in Annex A.
The principles of ISO/IEC 27001 are organized around a risk-based approach, and this ensures that the ISMS is
tailored to the specific risks faced by the organization. The approach promotes a culture of continuous
improvement, transparency, and accountability.
National Institute of Standards and Technology
Imagine taking the role as the new chief information security officer of a bank and the CEO asks you, “How
secure are we?” How would you approach answering this question? Or where could you go to get the
information? One place to start would be with the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). NIST
is a nonregulatory federal agency within the U.S. Department of Commerce that helps to set standards and
guidelines to ensure the security and privacy of information systems. NIST’s contribution to U.S. cybersecurity
is significant, as the agency provides resources, best practices, and frameworks to assist organizations in
safeguarding their information.
The NIST Special Publications 800 series is a collection of documents that cover various aspects of information
security. These publications provide guidelines, recommendations, and best practices to help organizations
manage and protect their information systems. Comparing the practices of your hypothetical bank against the
guidelines set forth by NIST could help you answer your boss’s question about security. One of the most
notable contributions from NIST is the framework for improving critical infrastructure cybersecurity, commonly
known as the NIST Cybersecurity Framework. This framework comprises five domains: identify, protect, detect,
respond, and recover (refer to Figure 5.7). Each domain involves specific security activities that, when
implemented, provide organizations with a strategic view of their cybersecurity posture.
Numerous organizations across different sectors have adopted NIST standards to enhance their cybersecurity
practices. For example, a financial institution might align its security policies and procedures with NIST’s best
practices to improve its resilience against cyber threats. In the health-care sector, a hospital might use NIST
guidelines to secure patient data and ensure HIPAA compliance. These real-world applications demonstrate
the versatility and effectiveness of NIST standards in bolstering cybersecurity defenses and fostering a culture
of security awareness and compliance.
Other Compliance Frameworks and Regulations
There are several frameworks and regulations in addition to NIST, NIST-800, and ISO/IEC 27001 that guide
information security policy within an organization. Many of these depend on the nature of the business, the
type of data that is collected, or even the geographic location of the business’s headquarters.
•
The Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) is a U.S. law that is part of the E-Government
Act of 2002. It is designed to bolster information security across federal agencies, and it establishes a
comprehensive framework that mandates agencies to develop, document, and implement security
programs to protect information and assets. FISMA emphasizes a risk-based policy for cost-effective
5.3 • Information Security and Risk Management Strategies
187

security, requiring agencies to conduct regular risk assessments, implement security measures, and
undergo continuous monitoring. Compliance with FISMA demonstrates an organization’s commitment to
protecting governmental information and assets.
•
The Health Information Technology for Economical and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act, enacted in 2009,
represents significant legislation in health information technology and privacy. It aims to promote the
adoption and meaningful use of health information technology, while also strengthening the privacy and
security provisions of HIPAA. HITECH introduced stricter enforcement of HIPAA rules and increased
penalties for noncompliance, emphasizing the need for health-care providers and related entities to
safeguard electronic protected health information (ePHI). It also incentivized the implementation of
electronic health records (EHRs), marking a transformative step in the modernization of health-care data
management and security.
Developing a Comprehensive Risk Management Plan
A risk management plan (RMP) is a strategic document that outlines how risk is assessed, monitored, and
mitigated within an organization. An RMP is a critical component in an organization’s information security and
risk management strategy. It provides a structured four-stage approach to identifying, assessing, mitigating,
and monitoring potential risks that could compromise sensitive data, intellectual property, and other vital
assets. This strategic document is crucial for shaping an organization’s cybersecurity posture, guiding the
allocation of resources, and prioritizing actions to enhance resilience against cyber threats.
Phase 1: Risk Identification
The initial phase of developing an RMP, identifying potential risks, is the priority. This process involves using
various techniques and tools to uncover vulnerabilities, threats, and potential impact on organizational assets.
A strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT) analysis is a commonly used method that
helps in understanding both internal and external factors that could pose risks. When applied to risk
identification in ISRM, SWOT becomes a powerful instrument in the hands of cybersecurity professionals. The
SWOT analysis in Figure 5.10 shows how it has been used and adapted to meet the needs of a team assessing
their own information security. By evaluating the strengths of an organization, such as robust security policies
or advanced technological infrastructure, professionals can form policies that enhance brand value, increase
employee awareness to reduce attacks, and make data-informed decisions regarding system upgrades.

The assets at risk in an organization can be vast and varied, including tangible assets such as hardware and
intangible assets such as data and intellectual property. Protecting these assets requires a clear understanding
of their value and the potential repercussions of any compromise. To aid in this process, a range of tools and
technologies is available. Scanners, for instance, can automatically detect vulnerabilities in a network, while AI-
based solutions offer advanced capabilities to predict and identify emerging threats. By employing these tools
and methodologies, organizations can develop a clear and actionable understanding of their risk landscape,
laying the foundation for effective risk management.
Phase 2: Risk Assessment
The risk assessment phase is a critical stage in the RMP, where the organization dives into the potential
likelihood and impact of various identified risks. This process is like a detective’s investigation, where each clue
helps in prioritizing risks based on their severity. Imagine a team of cybersecurity experts evaluating a network
system, much like detectives combing through a crime scene. They identify potential threats and
vulnerabilities, such as what types of data are at risk, what protections are currently in place, and what
additional measures are necessary to close any security gaps.
This phase is not just about finding problems, but also about devising strategies to mitigate them. Through
risk assessments, ISRM professionals can make data-driven decisions to align security measures with
organizational objectives. The comprehensive nature of risk assessment technologies and approaches
highlights the need for ISRM professionals to have a similar breadth and depth of knowledge. With the
appropriate certifications and continuous learning, these professionals can contribute to a safer and more
secure digital landscape.
The two predominant assessment methods are quantitative and qualitative.
•
Quantitative assessment: Quantitative assessments are often viewed as more time intensive than
qualitative but can be more accurate when evaluating risk. The impact of the risk is often evaluated in the
context of the expected cost of the risk. One method used in quantitative risk assessment is expected
monetary value (EMV) analysis, which is a mathematical calculation for determining the expected
monetary impact of risks: it multiplies the dollar cost of a risk by the probability of that risk occurring and
then adds the values together for all risks. A decision tree analysis is another quantitative method that is
more visual than EMV (Figure 5.11). The decision tree includes each risk, along with its financial impact and
the probability associated with each risk. The project manager then can see the path that offers the least
impact (cost) on the project. Regardless of the method chosen, quantitative risk assessment involves
calculations that give a monetary value to the impact of the risks to the project.
•
Qualitative assessment: Qualitative impacts can be categorized as high, medium, and low with the
probability of occurrence ranked on a scale from very likely to highly unlikely. Even though the
assessments are more subjective than the quantitative approaches, there are methods that can facilitate
the processes. For example, a brainstorming session with key stakeholders or with the project team could
generate a list of potential risks. Additionally, in-depth interviews with experts or stakeholders can identify
risks and begin to assess the impact and probability. A SWOT analysis can be used as well. In particular, the
internal weaknesses and the external threats can be considered risks to evaluate in the project.

Figure 5.11 This hypothetical decision tree analysis shows how it can help a project manager visualize the various risks associated
with a project. Through calculations such as EMV, the project manager can quantify the path that offers the least impact. (attribution:

Another method used when conducting the qualitative assessment of risks is the Delphi method, which
involves rounds of questionnaires sent to individuals with expertise who provide anonymous responses in
which they identify risks and assess their impact and probabilities. The project manager will analyze the
responses after each round to look for commonalities. Then, the compiled results are presented to the experts
again and they have the opportunity reevaluate the responses and amend the list. The end result of the Delphi
method is a list of risks that the experts have arrived at through this consensus-building process. Whatever
method is used for conducting the qualitative assessment of the RMP, the important factor is to get input from
various stakeholders and experts in the field to identify the risks and then organize the risks based on their
impact and probability of occurrence. Figure 5.12 illustrates the contrast between quantitative and qualitative
assessments when applied to an organization that specializes in IP generation.

matrix can be used with both qualitative and quantitative assessments. In qualitative assessments, the matrix
will be populated with categories that are subjective, such as high probability or low impact, whereas a
quantitative risk matrix would include the numerical measures of these values. Often the matrix is color coded
with a predetermined color scheme to help quickly identify those risks that have the highest impact or
probability.
In Figure 5.13, the highest-risk items are highlighted in red with the lower-risk items in green. Each risk matrix
can be evaluated by the project manager to determine which risks should be monitored more closely and to
prioritize the highest impact items. Then, the RMP can address the appropriate risk mitigation strategies for
those higher priority items while putting less focus on risks with minimal overall impact on the project.

Phase 3: Risk Mitigation Strategies
Uncertainty in projects cannot be eliminated, but it can be mitigated. Some broad mitigation strategies include
being proactive and developing a plan to deal with risks if they materialize. Each identified risk should have a
strategy attached so that there is a plan in place to minimize the impact of the risk on the project. These broad
strategies offer some general decisions that can be made with each risk; however, the actual activities used to
alleviate the impact will need to be tailored to the specific risk. Figure 5.14 lists broad strategies for dealing
with risk.
Figure 5.14 Developing action plans on how to deal with each risk in RMP can save time and money in the long run. (attribution:
Copyright Rice University, OpenStax, under CC BY 4.0 license)
The first strategy, acceptance, describes a situation where the risk, impact, and probability are known, and the
project team makes the decision to accept the impact. The risk might be at a level where it would not have a
meaningful impact on the overall project. In some cases, the benefit of accepting the risk outweighs any
negative impacts from the risk. Generally, the acceptance strategy is used when there are minimal impacts to
the cost, the schedule, or team performance. It is important to continue to monitor the risk to ensure the
impact remains at an acceptable level. Overall, the project continues to move forward without substantive
consequences to the project plan and deliverables.
5.3 • Information Security and Risk Management Strategies
191

In the avoidance approach, the project team develops strategies to prevent the risk from occurring. For
example, to avoid the risk of a new CRM system not functioning properly, the system could be tested with key
stakeholders to make sure it meets performance measures. With risk avoidance, the project manager might
consider moving resources from one part of the project (such as personnel or funding) to another part to help
reduce the risk. Risk avoidance is used when there are risks to performance and could involve having backup
vendors in case one vendor cannot fulfill what they are contracted to do. Avoiding risks to the schedule may
involve setting realistic deadlines that are not too aggressive.
The control approach to mitigating risks involves trying to minimize the impact of risks. This involves
consistent monitoring and having a plan in place to proactively respond to the risks. For example, tracking
expenses against the expected budget at regular intervals can help the project team identify when line items
are at risk of going over budget. When the project manager notices this, they can then implement strategies to
manage the expense in that line to control the risk of going over budget. To control the risk of going over
schedule, the project manager can keep close tabs on the time needed for tasks and redelegate as needed to
make sure the project stays on time.
The transfer strategy can be used to shift the risk—and thus the impact—to another entity associated with the
project. However, this approach may not be the best strategy because unintended consequences can arise. For
example, if the project is running behind schedule, the project manager could transfer the cause of that delay
to an individual team member rather than to the project team as a whole. Although the project team’s
reputation might be preserved somewhat, this kind of action could greatly impact the team dynamics.
Likewise, if the impact of a product’s failure is transferred to a particular vendor used to produce the product,
the business relationship could be altered, even if the costs of the failure are no longer the responsibility of the
project team. Caution should be used when choosing this strategy because of the additional consequences
that could result.
Finally, the watch strategy involves essentially taking no action but having activities in place in the project plan
to consistently monitor the risk for changes that could either increase the probability of occurrence or increase
the impact. Strategies such as tracking the actual expenses versus budgeted expenses on a regular basis, or
having project team updates on the status of action items, can be used to watch for changes. Monitoring is a
key strategy that should be used for all risks identified and should be a key component of the RMP. The bottom
line with any of the approaches to risk mitigation is to invest time on the front end of the planning process to
be proactive in how the project team responds to risk.
Phase 4: Monitoring and Review
The implementation of risk mitigation strategies is not the end of the risk management process. In fact,
mitigation requires ongoing attention and diligence to ensure its effectiveness and adaptability to new threats
and changes in the organization’s environment. This phase emphasizes the necessity of continuous
monitoring and regular reviews to maintain the integrity of the RMP.
Frameworks for Continuous Monitoring and Improvement of the ISRM
Strategy
The ongoing process of assessing the security posture and compliance of an IT infrastructure by automatically
collecting, analyzing, and reporting data on various security controls is called continuous monitoring. It is
critical for detecting and responding to threats and vulnerabilities in real time. It helps to ensure that the
implemented risk mitigation strategies are working as intended and that no new risks have emerged.
Continuous monitoring aids in maintaining a strong security posture, as it provides ongoing insights into the
effectiveness of security controls and the organization’s overall risk exposure.
Continuous monitoring plays an important role in ensuring the ongoing integrity, availability, and security of
critical assets and information. Continuous monitoring is a necessary component of an effective ISRM strategy,
ensuring that security controls are operating as intended and that any malicious activities are detected and

addressed in a timely manner.
The Information Systems Audit and Control Association (ISACA) is an international association that
provides IT professionals with knowledge, credentials, education, and community in IT governance, control,
risk, security, audit, and assurance. IT governance is the process of managing and controlling an organization's
IT capabilities to improve IT management, ensure compliance, and increase the value of IT investments. ISACA
offers several certifications and comprehensive cyber education and plays an important role in setting global
standards for cybersecurity. Through its publications, certifications, and guidance, ISACA provides industry
best practices and frameworks that organizations can adopt to enhance their monitoring capabilities and align
with relevant regulatory requirements.
One of ISACA’s most notable contributions to the field is the development of the Control Objectives for
Information and Related Technologies (COBIT) framework (Figure 5.15), a comprehensive framework
developed by ISACA for IT governance and management that helps organizations meet business challenges in
the areas of regulatory compliance, risk management, and aligning IT strategy with organizational goals.19 In
addition to COBIT5, NIST also provides a continuous monitoring strategy.20 It is recognized globally and is
widely adopted by organizations seeking to align their IT processes with their strategic objectives, while
ensuring that risks are managed effectively and resources are used responsibly.
Figure 5.15 The COBIT5 framework consists of five principles that scaffold an IT governance structure. (attribution: Copyright Rice
University, OpenStax, under CC BY 4.0 license)
Various tools and technologies play a pivotal role in facilitating continuous monitoring, each serving specific
purposes and providing different insights into the organization’s security posture.
One of the key tools available for continuous monitoring is a security information and event management
(SIEM) system, a centralized security tool that combines security information management with security event
19
COBIT5 was published in 2012, and a new version (COBIT 2019) was released in 2018. COBIT 2019 was updated for newer
technology and has six principles that use some revised terminology. Although COBIT 2019 is the most current version, many
organizations still use COBIT5. 6.3 Data Security and Privacy from a Global Perspective discusses COBIT 2019.

management. The tool collects, consolidates, and organizes data within the system, including user data,
application data, and network data, to analyze and detect suspicious activity within the system. The
aggregated data are analyzed to detect unusual activities, patterns, or events. The tools not only detect attacks
but can also prevent and block threats to the system. Additionally, the tool can compile the necessary
information for compliance reporting purposes. Finally, the SIEM system can monitor user actions to identify
potential issues before those actions pose a threat to the organization. For example, if confidential employee
information is being shared via email to an entity outside of the company that is not known to have a business
need for the information, the SIEM system can flag those emails as threats. In a similar way, the system can
identify incoming phishing emails and automatically block the sender. Through analytics, the SIEM system can
quickly recognize unusual activity and take appropriate action to minimize the impact.
An intrusion detection system (IDS) is integrated into the SIEM system. The IDS looks specifically at traffic on
the network to determine if there is suspicious activity coming into or out of the network. That data are then
fed into the SIEM system to be aggregated with the other data gathered. The IDS can also detect security
violations within the network. The tool does not stop the threat; it simply identifies the threat, sends the data
on, and alerts network administrators of the threat. The IDS looks for known sources of threats. For example,
the detection system could pick up on a specific chain of characters or source code that is part of a known
malware threat. Because the IDS checks traffic against known threats, it is important to regularly update the
system to make sure the newest cyber threats are being monitored.
The IDS works in conjunction with an intrusion prevention system (IPS) to prevent ongoing attacks to the
network. The IPS is a more proactive approach to maintaining the security of the network. One example of an
IPS is a firewall web application that prevents downloading of material from unsecured websites. To prevent
threats from entering the network, all traffic goes through the IPS before entering the network. As with the
IDS, the IPS works off of known threats, so new cyberattacks might get through. When suspicious activity is
noticed, the IPS will block the activity from getting into the network, send an alert to administrators (facilitated
by the SIEM system), and often terminate the connection where the threat originated in the system. This could
mean a user is disconnected from the system to prevent further intrusion until the threat can be mitigated.
Today’s IPS tools have detection capabilities built in and are now referred to as intrusion detection and
prevention systems (IDPSs). Many organizations use one integrated tool rather than having two separate tools
to manage security.

Certifications and Degree Programs for Careers in Information Security
Continuous professional development is fundamental in information security. As threats become more
sophisticated and bad actors continue to refine their craft, ongoing education is necessary. Within this context,
certifications and formal education programs serve dual purposes. First, they provide the foundational and
advanced knowledge required to confront emerging security challenges effectively. Second, they serve as
universally recognized markers of expertise, enhancing career prospects and lending credibility to skills.
The role of certifications in information security is important. A certification such as Certified Ethical Hacker
(CEH) signifies proficiency in ethical hacking techniques and tools, and the ability to assess the security of
computer systems by looking for vulnerabilities in a lawful and legitimate manner. CompTIA is a professional
organization that specializes in certifications in IT. Security+ is an entry-level certification from CompTIA that
covers foundational skills and knowledge in network security, compliance, operational security, threats and
vulnerabilities, data and host security, access control, and identity management. Other certifications offer
structured learning paths and are often prerequisites for specialized roles in the industry (Table 5.7). For
example, Certified Information Security Manager (CISM) focuses on management and governance of
information security, and Certified Information Systems Security Professional (CISSP) is an advanced
certification that focuses on the knowledge and skills required to design, implement, and manage a
comprehensive information security program. Certifications act as both a road map for skill acquisition and a
validation of those skills, especially valuable for professionals looking to transition into higher-level positions.

information security roles.
Both certifications and formal degree programs are vital in shaping a path to a successful career in
information security. They equip professionals with the skills needed to adapt and thrive in a dynamic
environment while simultaneously serving as benchmarks of competence for employers.
Empowering Cybersecurity Careers: Value and Impact of Professional Certifications
and Related Degrees
Certifications and degrees in information security play an important role in validating a professional’s skills and
competencies. While traditional degree programs offer a broad scope of knowledge, certifications are focused
on skill sets and methodologies directly applicable to the job. Unlike generic evaluations or internal
assessments within an organization, certifications are designed and recognized by industry experts. Obtaining
a certification often requires passing rigorous exams and, in some instances, demonstrating hands-on
expertise in a controlled environment. As such, certifications act as a third-party endorsement of a
professional’s capabilities, lending weight to résumés and professional profiles.
Certifications
CEH certification concentrates on penetration testing and vulnerability assessments, skills immediately
deployable in the workplace. Cisco’s Certified Network Professional (CCNP), which focuses on advanced
networking practices, is highly sought after by employers looking to increase their talent pool. Selecting the
right certifications is a foundational step for a strong and definitive career path in information security.
Certifications signal to employers that a candidate possesses a level of technical insight that has been
rigorously evaluated and approved by a recognized accrediting body. In an increasingly competitive job
market, such validation can distinguish one individual from other professionals in the field, and in many cases,
it may be a formal requirement for securing a particular role.
Each certification level, whether entry-level or advanced, typically builds on the last, creating a pathway for
continuous skill acquisition and career progression. This is particularly significant in information security. By
regularly updating and expanding your certification portfolio, you are not just meeting the requirements of
your current role, but also preparing yourself for the more complex challenges that lie ahead in higher-level
positions.
For example, suppose you are an IT professional with experience in data analysis, and you are interested in
transitioning into a threat intelligence analyst role. In this case, CompTIA Cybersecurity Analyst (CySA+) would
be a strategic certification to pursue. The CySA+ specializes in behavioral analytics to identify cybersecurity
threats, a skill often required for threat intelligence analysis. For more senior roles, such as information
security manager or CISO, the CISSP is considered a gold standard. The CISSP provides a comprehensive
overview of information security and may be a requirement for high-level security roles within large
organizations.
Aligning certifications with career goals can deliver tangible benefits, enabling individuals to tailor their
professional development to meet the expectations of future roles. It is worth investing the time to research
and select the certifications that offer the most direct path toward a desired career trajectory in the field of
information security.

Degree Programs
Earning certifications in cybersecurity-related fields can help with obtaining employment with many
employers. However, degree programs complement the certification stack and demonstrate to potential
employers that you can perform tasks both in an academic and in a technical manner. Additionally, many
employers seek individuals who possess a degree in higher education for higher level roles in an organization
such as chief information officer or CISO. For example, in their analysis of employer hiring behaviors, one
study found that several employers favored those who possessed a degree accompanied by certifications over
those with certifications alone (Figure 5.16).21

Undergraduate programs: Bachelor in cybersecurity. Many institutions offer a bachelor’s degree in a
cybersecurity-related discipline. Several of these programs incorporate general networking, ethical
hacking, penetration testing, programming in various languages (such as Python, C#, and C++), and
network defense. Additionally, these programs often have specializations or “tracks” that allow students to
specialize in a particular area of cybersecurity. According to the U.S. Bureau of Statistics, the number of
jobs related to cybersecurity to be added by the year 2033 could be more than 59,000.22 Many of these
positions require a minimum of a bachelor’s degree coupled with certifications to be considered for
employment.
•
Graduate programs: Master in cybersecurity. Those holding this credential are often sought after by
enterprise organizations looking to hire senior-level managers to oversee teams in a cybersecurity
environment. Those enrolled in these programs acquire industry-recognized skills along with skills in
leadership and management. The curriculum in these programs is normally designed to expose learners
to practical skills that can be immediately applied upon graduation.
