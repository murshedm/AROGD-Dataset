Introduction
Project management is a fundamental component of IS and nontechnical projects. The history of information
technology (IT) project management can be traced back to the 1950s, when huge computer systems were
designed to be used by the government. As computer systems became more complex, formal project
management practices emerged, such as a technique called the critical path method and the Program
Evaluation and Review Technique.
In the 1970s, project management became more structured with the development of standards such as the
Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK) created by the Project Management Institute (PMI). These
standards enabled the profession to explode in the 1980s, and the establishment of the Project Management
Professional certification further fueled this expansion. Since then, IT and IS project management has become
a career many professionals with IS expertise choose—and businesses are eager to employ them.
Today, IT and IS project management is one of the fastest growing professions in the world. It brings together
the elements of IS—such as hardware and software, data management, information security and risks—with
steps to keep the team and product in scope, on budget, and within schedule. With the emergence of new
software, technologies, and methodologies, businesses need effective project management to optimize
complex capital projects, strategic operational initiatives, and day-to-day operations.

9.1 Foundations of Information Systems Project Management
Learning Objectives
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
•
Identify concepts, skills, and techniques associated with project management
•
Distinguish between project management, program management, and portfolio management
•
Apply project management, program management, and portfolio management skills
Project management is a fast-growing field. Businesses are complex and intricate systems that aim to provide
products and services to their clients or customers. Project management is an aspect of business systems that
provides specific tools and best practices to manage and lead the business. Project management focuses on
people, assets, money, and time, and project managers use people, assets, money, and time to lead and
manage initiatives that provide the products and services a business sells to its customers. In project
management, an initiative, task, or activity is categorized as a project regardless of its complexity and who
might oversee its implementation. For example, a task as simple as purchasing new phones or computers for
employees can be categorized as a project because phones and computers are critical components of modern-
day business and the process of purchasing has a time limit. Without these items, the business would probably
not operate.
Concepts and Methodologies of Project Management
The Project Management Institute (PMI) is the main accrediting body for the project management process
and certifies project managers, program managers, and portfolio managers. The PMI promotes the use of a
structured, process-based approach to managing projects. The Project Management Body of Knowledge
(PMBOK), developed by PMI, is a guide for handling projects using a systematic methodology and proven
processes for initiating, planning, executing, managing, monitoring, and closing a project. PMBOK will be the
basis for much of the project management foundations covered here.
Overall project management describes the use of specific knowledge, skills, tools, and techniques to provide
guidance through each stage of a project. Project management involves planning, organizing, and controlling
resources—such as people and materials—to achieve specific goals or objectives within a defined timeline. The
person responsible for leading the efforts to plan, organize, and control the resources using various tools and
techniques to initiate, plan, execute, monitor, control, and close projects is called a project manager (PM). A
project is a temporary initiative or endeavor to create a product, service, or result that has beginning and end
dates. “Temporary” in this sense only means that a project must have a beginning and an end; it does not refer
to the length of the project Figure 9.2. Expanding sales into a new market segment, developing an information
system to manage an internal process, opening a new branch of the enterprise, and implementing disaster
recovery after a system or security failure—these are all examples of projects.

A project can follow any timeline, lasting a week, a month, or many years, for example, as long as it meets the
definition of a project. A project is considered completed once the scope or requirements have been met or

once the objectives of the project have been achieved in accordance with the customer, sponsor of the project,
or internal champion of the project. Projects can vary depending on the industry or the environment in which
the projects are conducted. For example, a research institution might conduct research projects on new ways
to upskill its workforce, while a pharmaceutical company might conduct a project on a new drug to cure
Alzheimer’s. In the IS field, most projects involve technology and thus are considered technical in nature. An IS
project manager might be involved in integrating a new technology into a university’s student information
system or producing a new process to build electronic vehicles for a car manufacturer.
Project management is used in some form in many organizations. It crosses over many disciplines like
construction, business, health care, manufacturing, and other industries where businesses initiate projects
that need to be managed by an expert (project manager) who can ensure the project stays within budget,
scope, and schedule. A project manager is a key employee with skills in leadership, management, project
management, human resources, finance, procurement, contracts, and operations.
Differences Between Project Management, Program Management, and Portfolio
Management
Program management and portfolio management can be thought of as managing groups of projects. The
coordinated organization, direction, and implementation of a group of related projects is called program
management. This related group of projects seeks to achieve outcomes and realize benefits that are
strategically important to the business. Being coordinated means there are common rules to manage each
project, such as when to escalate an issue or that all documentation for each project is similarly organized to
group the projects together within the business. A portfolio is simply a collection of projects or programs that
are grouped together but may not be interdependent of each other. Usually, these projects are grouped
together to more effectively manage the projects based on the business objectives. Therefore, portfolio
management is the centralized management of a set of projects grouped together to identify, prioritize,
authorize, and control the related work Figure 9.3.
Figure 9.3 In portfolio management, programs or projects are grouped together to realize more efficiency between those programs
or projects. Program management groups related projects together to realize a similar outcome for the business. (attribution:

Understanding project management begins with understanding the underlying principles of the various
methodologies used to manage projects. The PMI developed the PMBOK framework and certifies Agile and
PRINCE2 frameworks. Each of these frameworks and their supporting methodologies have certain principles
that impact how projects are managed. The one thing they have in common is that they all come with
documentation, best practices, and processes for managing teams, assets, and deliverables, and they have a
very prescribed way to measure the success of each component.
Project management has many different components, complexities, and concepts to support the organization
and success of projects. In most IS project management organizations, there is a hierarchical organization of
the project management profession, similar to the various management and leadership levels found in health
9.1 • Foundations of Information Systems Project Management
333

care, marketing, technology, finance, and higher education. Even though the structure is hierarchical, the team
supporting the managers and leaders does not always report to the manager or leader of that department.
Project Management Using Project Management Body of Knowledge
The PMBOK is a waterfall approach, which means that each step is followed by the next step, which is followed
by the next, and so on. While the sequential design of project steps is central to PMBOK, newer versions of the
methodology emphasize that some concepts, such as risk, are more iterative (or repeated), and they must be
revisited or monitored frequently.
In PMBOK, the development, monitoring, and control of a project is called the project life cycle (PLC) (Figure
9.4). The PLC is a sequence of phases that a project encounters as it progresses from start to finish. The phases
include the following:
•
Feasibility: In this phase, it is determined whether the organization has the capability to deliver the
product.
•
Design: This is the planning and analysis phase.
•
Building: This phase covers the actual implementation of the project and its project plan.
•
Testing: After building the project, the processes must be tested. In this phase, a quality review and
inspection of the deliverables are conducted.
•
Deployment: With the other phases in the process complete, the project can be deployed. This is when all
deliverables are finalized and transitioned to sustainability.
•
Closing: In this phase, all the knowledge and artifacts related to the project are archived, and the team
members are released.
Figure 9.4 The project life cycle is a series of phases that a project goes through from start to finish. (attribution: Copyright Rice
University, OpenStax, under CC BY 4.0 license)
The PMBOK also defines eight domains that guide project managers through the PLC (Figure 9.5). The
domains are defined as what the project manager must focus on in each stage to complete that stage. These
eight domains ensure successful delivery of the project:
•
Stakeholders: Anyone involved or impacted by the delivery of the projects is a stakeholder.
•
Team: People who are stakeholders but also invested in the project deliverables are part of the team.
•
Development approach: This is the manner in which the phases of the project are planned.
•
Planning: The focus of planning is the organization of the project and how it is going to be implemented.
•
Project work: The project work includes the necessary items and processes of each deliverable in the
project.
•
Delivery: This is the actual transition of the project deliverables to the stakeholders.
•
Measurement: Measurement includes determining whether the performance of the project and the
people are delivering within an expected quality level.
334

•
Uncertainty: The focus of this domain is management of the risks associated with the project.
Figure 9.5 The eight domains of performance are what the project manager must focus on in each stage to complete that stage.

Let’s look briefly at some domains—stakeholders, team, development approach, and planning—to understand
what it means to deliver a project on time within scope, on budget, within acceptable quality levels, and with
minimal risk.
Stakeholders’ Domain
The stakeholders’ domain is a lot about communication and ensuring a good relationship is established with
all the individuals associated with a project. Stakeholders include individuals, groups, or organizations that
may affect, be affected by, or perceive themselves to be affected by a decision, activity, or outcome related to a
project, program, or portfolio. A project’s stakeholders could include members of the organization’s leadership
team, customers, clients, coworkers on the project team, middle management, vendors, regulatory bodies,
steering committees—the list goes on and on. Communication and relationships with all stakeholders
throughout the project are important to the success of the project. The stakeholders on a given project may
shift over time, so keeping up with the list of individuals and groups can be challenging.
In the stakeholders’ domain, three desired outcomes should be pursued:
•
maintaining a productive relationship throughout the project
•
making sure stakeholders are in agreement with the project objectives
•
ensuring that stakeholders, who are beneficiaries, are supportive of the project and do not negatively
impact project outcomes, such as trying to change the scope of the project or vetoing budget items
important to the project
It is important to manage the stakeholders and their expectations both positively and negatively. For example,
you could have a stakeholder who has not clearly understood the scope of the project and has additional
requirements that are not included in the scope. As the project is developed and the project does not include
these items, the stakeholder then believes the requirements have not been met. These expectations and
beliefs must be identified as soon as possible.
One way to manage stakeholders is to perform a stakeholder analysis. A stakeholder analysis is a review and
evaluation of each stakeholder, their background, expertise, and impact on the project. It involves a systematic
9.1 • Foundations of Information Systems Project Management
335

gathering of quantitative and qualitative data to determine whose interests in the project should be a priority.
The stakeholder or group of stakeholders whose interests are a priority are likely to have more power and
authority over the project than other stakeholders. These stakeholders are the ones to assure, so it’s also
important to make sure they are informed and satisfied throughout the project.
Team Domain
The team consists of the individuals who are responsible for building or producing project deliverables. If team
members don’t work well together, it reflects poorly on the project manager. In fact, it is the project manager’s
job to create a work environment in which team members work to ensure that deliverables are of high quality
and are delivered on time and within budget, with minimal risk. The successful outcome of the project is
dependent on the project team and its performance. The need for communication and relationship building
among diverse team members is one of the reasons a project manager must be a good leader and
communicator in addition to knowing when to push and when to let the team manage its own
accomplishments. Establishing a shared-team mindset when it comes to deliverables, quality, and timelines is
the goal of the project manager.
Development Approach and Life Cycle Domain
There are many different approaches to project development, which is the process of planning a project and
ensuring it has the resources necessary to successfully achieve its goals and objectives. The approaches to the
PLC highlighted by PMBOK are predictive, adaptive, and incremental development (Figure 9.6).
Figure 9.6 The predictive, adaptive, and incremental approaches to project development provide frameworks to develop different
types of projects depending on an organization’s culture and specific project needs. (attribution: Copyright Rice University, OpenStax,
under CC BY 4.0 license)
The predictive development approach is generally used for projects that have specific requirements with
336
9 • Information Systems Project Management
Access for free at openstax.org

well-defined goals and objectives. The entire project is planned from start to finish before the project begins,
and once the project is implemented, the plan is followed carefully. This includes adhering to the scope of
work and project deadlines to meet requirements, design, construct, test, and deliver outputs according to
plan.
When a project needs more flexibility, the adaptive development approach provides a framework that
enables project team members to repeat the processes of cycle planning and task initiation as needed. This
provides an opportunity to respond to client feedback and make changes in the project requirements as part
of the ongoing processes. As they repeat the processes, team members are expected to learn by doing and
then apply their new knowledge to improve the final project outputs.
The incremental development approach enables a project to be divided into parts, or increments, that work
together and build on each other to accomplish the overall project. Dividing a project into smaller parts makes
each part more manageable. Typically, as each part of the project is done, the project team delivers the
outputs for that part, providing an opportunity for feedback on the project’s progress. This allows for changes
to be made as each part of the project is completed, ensuring that the final product meets the overall project
goals and objectives.
Each approach selected depends on the type of project, company culture, organizational structure,
organizational capabilities, size of the team, and the location of the team. The workplace culture of the
company or your stakeholders’ characteristics may dictate the development approach. When it comes to
project management, there is never a one-size-fits-all approach. There are many factors to consider, and the
approach and PLC can vary from project to project.
Depending on the needs of the project and the culture of the organization, an iterative approach could involve
a hybrid method with modifications as needed to fit the project. Another consideration when deciding which
approach to use is the degree of innovation involved in a project. This refers to how much change a project
introduces. Some projects are minimally innovative, offering incremental changes, while others are more
radical, offering changes that are disruptive and even transformative to operations or products.
For example, you may have a project that is very lengthy in duration with lots of interdependencies where the
product must be delivered before the next process or components can be built. Say you are leading a project
to build a space shuttle. There would be several components that would need to be developed prior to others,
but there are some parts that can be delivered in conjunction with each other, like the engines and the capsule
for the payload. You can develop the engines while you are developing the capsule because they are not
necessarily dependent on each other. The engines are dependent on the weight of the payload, and the
capsules can be developed to deliver up to the maximum payload. You could use a predictive approach or even
an incremental approach for delivery.
Planning Domain and Project Work
The planning domain lasts throughout the length of the project and is associated with organizing,
collaborating, and elaborating on the project and the project deliverables. The project work domain is about
the execution of the project. It involves ensuring that the performance of the team and the product or service
and the outcomes maintain the appropriate quality and map to the desired outcomes of the project. Each
project requires the project manager to plan, coordinate, and manage the project in a holistic approach. No
two projects are ever alike.
As a project progresses, there is always a certain amount of feedback and information that needs to be
assessed for its impact on the project and its outcomes. Each project will evolve over time. The process of
determining the appropriate information to provide to the team needs to be handled and managed to achieve
the desired outcomes. The time spent planning for a project and the desired outcomes should be appropriate
to the project. Project planning and the project management documentation should always be sufficient to
manage stakeholder expectations. There are several project management tools and documents that project
9.1 • Foundations of Information Systems Project Management
337

managers use in the planning process, such as a vision statement, project charter, business case, initial project
plan, or RACI (responsible, accountable, consulted, and informed) charts.
LINK TO LEARNING
Consider this case study (https://openstax.org/r/109CaseStudy) that discusses how extensive planning was
used to address the disaster of roads being destroyed after a catastrophic weather event in British
Columbia. This example illustrates how the tools and techniques of project management can be used in the
professional and personal domains.
Agile Project Management
The Agile project management methodology involves taking an iterative and incremental approach to
delivering projects (refer to 4.1 Systems Analysis and Design for Application Development for more about Agile
methodologies). This means that instead of trying to plan and execute an entire project up front, the project
manager breaks the project down into smaller, manageable tasks. Project management teams using the Agile
method seek to deliver value incrementally and iteratively by delivering products frequently and engaging with
customers to gather feedback. This feedback is then incorporated into the project’s direction and objectives
immediately. The Agile approach ensures that the final product aligns closely with customer needs and
provides maximum value, meaning that the product delivers on the customer’s requirements and vision. This
approach is particularly good for projects where the client can’t agree on the entire scope of the project up
front.
Each chunk of work in an Agile project is broken into smaller components called user stories. User stories
represent specific features or functionality required by the customer. Agile teams review and prioritize these
functions and features. These tasks are then delivered in short iterations called sprints, which typically last
from one to four weeks. A sprint typically involves a number of user stories being developed and completed at
the same time. A meeting to discuss the user stories and divide the work is called a scrum meeting.
In Agile project management, there are several frameworks to support the iterative and collaborative
approach central to this methodology, including scrum, Kanban, and extreme programming.
A scrum is an Agile framework that focuses on delivering value through small, cross-functional teams working
in sprints, and the product backlog contains a prioritized list of user stories or features. [0]Prior to the start of
the sprint session, items from the backlog to be completed are planned out and chosen by team members.
During each sprint, the team members select items from the backlog to complete. Scrum meetings, often
referred to as stand-up meetings, backlog refinement, sprint planning, sprint review, and retrospective
sessions, usually happen daily, which enables the team to adapt and improve continuously. The leader of the
scrum meeting is called the scrum master and usually has a certification from PMI or other certifying bodies.
An Agile framework that helps managers visualize and optimize the flow of work. Kanban is a visual
representation of tasks and how they flow through the project (Figure 9.7). A Kanban board typically consists of
columns representing different stages of work, such as to do, in progress, or done. Each work item is
represented by a card, and team members move the cards across the board as work progresses. As work is
completed, team members start on the next task. The cards can be set up on a digital Kanban board (via tools
such as Asana, Jira, or Smartsheet) or simply with sticky notes on a wall or whiteboard. The Kanban framework
emphasizes limiting work in progress to maintain a smooth workflow while maintaining a continuous delivery
schedule. This framework helps teams identify bottlenecks, optimize their processes, and respond quickly to
changing priorities.

Figure 9.7 Referred to as a Kanban board, this type of Agile framework identifies the position of each component of work as the
project progresses. (credit: modification of work “Abstract Kanban Board” by Jennifer Falco/Wikimedia Commons, CC BY 4.0)
Primarily used in the software engineering industry, extreme programming (XP) is an Agile methodology that
emphasizes the use of software engineering practices to improve quality and responsiveness. Extreme
programming also emphasizes customer involvement, short development cycles, and continuous integration
and deployment. It incorporates practices like pair programming, test-driven development, frequent releases,
and collective code ownership. By prioritizing customer value, XP teams can respond effectively to changing
requirements and deliver high-quality software.
The advantage of an Agile approach is that it allows for flexibility and adaptability throughout a project’s term,
as teams can adjust their plans and incorporate feedback at the end of each sprint. The disadvantages are that
the client must be willing to put in significant time since Agile requires many reviews and evaluations of work
as the work continues. Many clients or companies do not have the time for their employees to be dedicated to
a project in this manner. Overall, the Agile methodology works well for small- to medium-sized projects and in
certain industries where flexibility and adaptability are crucial. For example, it might be suitable for a project
that is highly regulated where standards may change frequently while you are building the deliverables, such
as hospital information systems, or a new technology such as an AI application system where the capabilities
grow daily.
PRINCE2 Methodology
PRINCE2 (Projects in Controlled Environments) is a project management methodology and certification that
is widely recognized around the world. PRINCE2, much like PMBOK, uses a structured, process-based approach
to managing projects, but it is designed to be scalable and adaptable, making it suitable for projects of various
sizes and complexities. The PRINCE2 certification is often sought after by project managers, team members,
and individuals involved in project management roles around the world because it provides individuals with a
robust framework and a common language for managing projects effectively, as well as ensuring consistency
and the use of best practices in project management processes. PRINCE2 is built on seven principles that guide
its project management practices (Figure 9.8).
9.1 • Foundations of Information Systems Project Management
339

Figure 9.8 The PRINCE2 methodology is composed of seven guiding principles of project management. (attribution: Copyright Rice
University, OpenStax, under CC BY 4.0 license)
Principle One: Continually Justify Project
A PRINCE2 project must have a reason to be started, and that reason must make sense from a business point
of view; therefore, business justification is essential. The reason for the project, the funding and resources
needed, and the predicted return on investment (ROI) must all be identified. If the ROI is greater than the cost
of the project, then the project should be initiated. Each company typically has its own method of determining
a minimum ROI threshold before a project is started. In some cases, due to regulations or changing
technologies, companies must invest in projects to remain compliant with laws or stay competitive, which
should be taken into consideration. The business justification should be revisited throughout the project to
ensure that the ROI and reason for the project remain aligned or, at very least, the ROI does not drop below
expected levels.
Principle Two: Learn from Experience
This principle involves collecting data on lessons learned from previous projects to avoid repeating risky and
costly mistakes. In PRINCE2, project teams are constantly looking at the outcomes of the project to assess how
well it is progressing and to determine whether any lessons learned can be identified and used immediately as
the project continues. Each project can be unique and have its own set of challenges. These challenges can
create risks or unknowns. Project teams need to understand the nature of change and risk and adapt to new
situations. One example of learning from experience is discussing with other project managers with different
experiences how they might respond to the challenge you are facing.
Principle Three: Define Roles and Responsibilities
Determining the roles and responsibilities of stakeholders in a project is critical. In PRINCE2 methodology,
there is a process for identifying stakeholders that involves sorting them into three categories:
•
Business sponsors: Stakeholders who make sure the project delivers value for money.
•
Users: Stakeholders who are usually the people who will use the products once they have been created.
They benefit from completion of the project.
•
Suppliers: Stakeholders who provide the resources and expertise needed by the project to produce the
products.
Not all companies or organizations have a dedicated team of project managers and other employees focused
340

Access for free at openstax.org

just on delivering projects. Project teams can be made up of people from various departments and companies,
and therefore, defining each team member’s roles and responsibilities with respect to the project is key to
running it successfully and smoothly.
Principle Four: Manage by Stages
Like Agile project management, the PRINCE2 methodology aims to manage a project—and keep the project
team flexible and responsive—by breaking the project up into chunks or smaller tasks that it refers to as
stages. The three stages in PRINCE2 are planning, monitoring, and controlling, and they take place
sequentially one stage at a time. The stages are separated by decision points, sometimes called control points.
The need for continuous monitoring of the ROI is one of the reasons there are stages in PRINCE2. At the end
of each stage, the team conducts a performance assessment of the last stage to decide whether the project
should continue and, if it does continue, to determine any adjustments that need to be made.
This is also a point at which lessons learned can be assessed and applied for the next stage of the project. Like
in the Agile methodology where there are points along the way when customer or client feedback is called for,
the decision points of PRINCE2 function similarly, but the feedback comes from both the customer and other
stakeholders in the company and focuses not only on the product deliverables but also on the performance
and processes of the project team.
Principle Five: Manage by Exception
When managing by exception, the project manager has some leeway in the oversight of tasks, such as the
schedule, scope, and costs, defined in accordance with company policy. In PRINCE2, the leeway is referred to
as the tolerance level, or the extent to which project managers can accept the risk or need to escalate it.
Project managers know that if an issue in the project passes a certain tolerance level, they must escalate it. If
the project stays within the acceptable tolerance levels, the project manager can make adjustments where
needed to keep the project on budget, within scope, and on time. In PRINCE2, managing by exception means
that each level of leadership in the project manages the tolerance level below it in the organizational structure.
So, if there is a major issue with a project, you may hear a project manager say the risk is outside the tolerance
level range, meaning the issue needs to be escalated to the next level in the organizational chain of command.
There are six areas where tolerances or escalation points are applied: time, cost, quality, scope, risk, and
benefit. This means the project manager must know the tolerance level for each of these areas and escalate an
issue to the next level when necessary. For example, imagine your grandparents give you $500 on a credit card
for transportation and dining out for the semester, with the instruction to let them know if the dollar amount
gets too low or if you overspend by $20. This puts guidelines on the money but also ensures that the student
does not have to get approval for every charge made that semester.
Principle Six: Focus on Products
Focusing on the product, its definition, and its requirements is important with PRINCE2. Project stakeholders
join a project team bringing their own experiences and perspectives of the world, the project, and the product.
Focusing on the details of the product is important to ensure there are no misunderstandings that waste time
and money. To avoid this issue, the PRINCE2 methodology recommends developing a detailed product
description that guides the project, manages expectations, and ensures the required deliverables. The product
description should include a well-defined product purpose, composition, derivation, format, quality criteria,
and quality process. It also determines a project’s resource requirements, dependencies, and activities.
Principle Seven: Tailor to Project Environment
The principle of tailoring to the project environment is specific to the PRINCE2 methodology. A project should
be tailored to suit the project’s size, environment, complexity, capability, and risk. Similar to an Agile project
being flexible and adaptable to the project needs, this principle means that managing really small projects
does not require the full-blown documentation and requirements that more complex projects require. Some
9.1 • Foundations of Information Systems Project Management
341

core principles must be followed to get the project delivered, but in PRINCE2, you should be cognizant of the
environment in which the project should be managed. For example, if the environment of the company is one
in which management is not focused on following every principle in the PRINCE2 methodology, then as the
project manager, you should adapt to the environment and still deliver a quality product, on time, within
budget, in scope, with minimal risks.
Tools of the Trade
There are several project management software tools that help project managers control the scope, schedule,
and budget of a project. These tools can be as simple as using a spreadsheet to track deliverables and
important milestones to expensive software designed specifically to manage large and complex projects. The
size and complexity of the project would inform the decision as to which product to use.
Small projects can easily be managed using a spreadsheet like Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets. These
products have add-ons and functions that can be programmed into a spreadsheet to deliver a schedule or a
budget. Project managers can even create a dashboard and alerts within spreadsheets to help them stay on
top of the critical aspects of a project.
Midsize projects might require more robust software tools such as Microsoft Project, Jira, and Asana. These
tools feature items like Gantt charts, resource lists, and project budgets that are linked to a larger strategic
budget or accounting system. They can also include several reporting features to allow the project manager to
monitor schedule, costs, and scope, as well as robust graphics and color-coded systems to allow users to
understand when something needs attention or when something is behind schedule. Artificial intelligence can
be used to assist project managers in developing reports, monitoring schedules and budgets, and developing
alerts to let project managers know when any of these components go beyond the escalation point.
Larger complex projects, such as those found in the construction industry and occasionally in IT, may require
an even more robust system that can be customized to the type of project and have the company’s strategic
approach designed into the system, so that all users are using the same approaches and constraints. These
complex systems also incorporate risks into their approach and provide various “what if” scenarios to help
project managers compile the risks and constraints that may be part of a project. In addition, such systems
serve as a knowledge base as they can store all the documentation and historical data associated with various
projects. This assists with estimating pricing as well as developing future projects.

Project Management Office
The project management office (PMO) is the department within an organization that provides the standards
and guidelines to project managers for projects and governs how projects are initiated, planned, organized,
implemented, managed, and closed. This group of individuals sits at the top of the entire project/program/
portfolio management function. The PMO is equivalent to the C-suite of a company. Many times, project
managers will be part of this department but not always. Some project managers may be serving as functional
project managers while still residing in the department where they specialize. For example, an IS project
manager may be part of the business side of the organization rather than in the PMO office or the IT
department. The IS project manager might reside in the analytics, marketing, or operations departments.
The PMO, along with other members of the organization’s leadership, might determine parameters like the
structure of a project, who is able to manage such a project, the amount of risk the organization is willing to
accept, and the escalation points for larger changes, issues, and risks. Additionally, the PMO might support
342

project managers in various departments and make business decisions that the project manager cannot make
to align the project with the organization. The PMO is also usually where project information and its historical
data are kept. Any lessons learned from both successful and unsuccessful projects would be evaluated and
policies would be put in place to facilitate a smooth project management process. Some organizations may not
have a PMO but may still have units within the organization that govern and act like a PMO. In most
organizations with a PMO, the primary functions of this group are as follows:
•
Manage shared resources across all projects.
•
Identify and develop project methodology, best practices, and standards.
•
Coach, mentor, and train project managers.
•
Monitor compliance with standards, policies, and templates, especially in highly regulated industries.
•
Develop and manage policies, procedures, and other shared documentation.
•
Coordinate communication across various projects.
Project management offices can take many different shapes and sizes, but the principles by which they
operate remain the same (Figure 9.9).
Figure 9.9 Project management offices can take different shapes, sizes, and roles, depending on what is needed for a project.

Some examples of the types and functions of common PMOs are as follows:
•
Full service PMOs: They provide project management governance and guidance on how projects are
delivered. They provide everything from policies, standards, best practices, approaches, and guidelines, to
tools that project managers use.
•
Shared services PMOs: They offer services as needed for things such as planning activities, risk
management, performance tracking, and any other support the project manager may need. This type of
PMO usually exists in an organization where there are independent business units.
•
Information technology development PMOs: They oversee a portfolio, which is a collection of programs or
groups of projects. These PMOs usually maintain oversight of all projects that require organizational
approval and financial allocation. This type of PMO is centralized.
•
Enterprise-level PMOs: They link the implementation of an organization’s strategy with a portfolio of
projects. This kind of PMO is established and tightly connected to the organization’s leadership and overall
strategy, and it usually operates within organizations that develop new products or have different
business units or even different entities engaged in the development of many products.
•
Decentralized PMOs: They usually implement innovative approaches in project management, such as the
adaptive approach or Agile. This PMO plays more of a supporting role rather than serving an oversight
function. The PMO takes a coaching approach to supporting project managers and business units and
encourages training to make business owners and sponsors more effective at their jobs.
Program and Portfolio Management
Program and portfolio management are also part of an organization’s structure and dependent on the
capabilities of the business and its organizational strategy (Figure 9.10). A group of related projects,
subprograms, and program activities managed in a coordinated way to obtain value of delivery is known as
program management. Program management is above project management because program management
encompasses several projects and is part of the bigger, overall portfolio for an organization. In the context of
project management, portfolio management refers to projects, programs, and subportfolios, and operations
managed as a group to achieve strategic objectives or value for the organization. For example, you may have
9.1 • Foundations of Information Systems Project Management
343

an IT portfolio where you are delivering several projects related to an enterprise resource planning (ERP)
system. The ERP system has several different projects related to the various parts of the project, such as
human resources functions and accounts payable and receivable. You might have different project managers
working on the implementation of each function of the ERP system because it is a large undertaking. Each of
the project managers may report to the program manager of the ERP system or product. Above that, you
might have clients you are implementing this ERP product for, and each of those projects reports up to a
portfolio manager who may be a vice president or executive with the company.
Figure 9.10 Project, program, and portfolio management are tied to one another in a hierarchical way, with programs encompassing
multiple projects and portfolios encompassing programs and projects. (attribution: Copyright Rice University, OpenStax, under CC BY
4.0 license)
The purpose of program and portfolio management is to consistently deliver products and services that
produce better results and sustainability for the organization and its projects. The goals of portfolio, program,
and project management are to deliver value. Value is what keeps an organization in business and gives it a
competitive advantage. This is why program and portfolio management are so important to the strategic
operations of an organization.
Applying Project Management, Program Management, and Portfolio
Management Skills
Now, let’s consider a problem and determine which development approach—predictive, adaptive, or
incremental—should be used. Pay particular attention to performance domains.
Case Study: Choosing a Project Management Approach
Pharrell is a consultant for a small financial company that has asked him to manage its ERP system project. An
ERP system has functions for payroll, human resources, accounting, and finance. The company provides
financial planning and advice to small business owners who need to set up 401(k) retirement accounts for their
employees. The company’s ERP system needs to meet all federal and state regulations for institutions that
handle financial transactions. These regulations are monitored and controlled by the State Department of
Labor and several financial regulatory bodies. The ERP system must take into account that the company must
344
9 • Information Systems Project Management
Access for free at openstax.org

ensure that its employees are not making fraudulent financial transactions on behalf of their clients nor
violating any insider trading or financial regulations when they offer advice on the retirement accounts to the
small businesses.
The company is set up in a very flat organizational structure—meaning there are three vice presidents (one
each for accounting and finance, operations, and sales) and a president who oversees all three vice presidents.
There are several managers and supervisors in the company as well as administrative and operational
employees who report to the three vice presidents. The company has just hired ten new staff to make a total of
fifty-nine employees that work directly for the company. Some of the employees working on client accounts
have legal backgrounds. The ERP is a big system for the company. It has chosen to implement such a large
system because it wants to double its clients in the next two years, and this would mean hiring more
employees.
The company expects Pharrell to manage and implement the new ERP system without a lot of input from the
internal company employees, except for the three vice presidents and the president. Only the leadership of the
company will participate in the project, but all employees are stakeholders. The company will make employees
available to test the system, but Pharrell is expected to provide all the other human resources needed for the
project. Since he has implemented ERP systems before, he already has several individuals to work on this
project and is confident he can do the work.
Selecting a Project Development Approach
Recall what you learned about predictive, adaptive, and incremental project development. Consider the pros
and cons of each within the specifics of this project:
•
Degree of innovation: This project probably doesn’t require innovative thinking to solve a problem.
According to Pharrell, he has a team that has worked together before; therefore, they do not need to
consider assembling a team with innovative thinkers or use this approach.
•
Requirements certainty: The requirements for the system should be spelled out well since this is an
implementation of an ERP system, and there is only so much that needs to be modified to meet the
company’s requirements. So, a predictive approach may be the way to go.
•
Scope stability: The scope of the deliverables will probably not change given that this is an off-the-shelf
ERP system, but since the actual end-user stakeholders aren’t involved, the scope may change, especially
since the users are going to test the system. A predictive approach would be needed if the scope were
stable.
•
Ease of change: This also deals with scope and stability. If the deliverables are not going to change much,
then a predictive approach should be used.
•
Delivery options: Because an ERP system has many different functions, the project could be broken down
into functions and different groups could work on each function that needs to be delivered; an
incremental or iterative approach could be used.
•
Risk: One risk for the project would be that the deliverables may change once the end users are utilizing
the system, or the vice presidents may not have the time to dedicate to the project to determine the
requirements. For a project with these kinds of risks, a predictive approach would work best, at least in the
beginning, as it would help define the requirements.
•
Safety requirements: The product should not have any safety-related requirements that would physically
harm someone, so this consideration may not apply to the project.
•
Regulations: This project would be highly regulated since the nature of the company is in finance and
retirement accounts. Even though the business of the company may not have a lot to do with the ERP
system, other than accounts receivable, the project does have to implement some of the regulations
required to manage the employees of the company.
Based on this analysis of the various approaches, this project should be developed using the predictive
approach. With the number of regulations to satisfy and the fact that the scope will probably not change much
9.1 • Foundations of Information Systems Project Management
345

because of these regulations, this approach will serve Pharrell well. This doesn’t mean that later in the project
an incremental or Agile-related approach would not be more useful, it just means that up front, the more
planning Pharrell can put into this project, the better the project will be executed, and the greater chance that
the delivery will be smooth.
9.2 Setting Up and Managing Projects for Success
Learning Objectives
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
•
Explain the stages of a project from initiation to closing
•
Explain how to develop a project plan and schedule
•
Determine how to identify, evaluate, and mitigate project risks
Project management is about properly understanding the requirements for a project and being able to
manage that project based on scope, costs, schedule, quality, and risks. Project managers need to understand
the role each of these plays on the project from initiation to closing. The PMBOK approach provides guidance
on how to set up and manage projects successfully.
Project Stages
In project management, the successful execution of a project depends on a structured approach applied
across various stages. These stages provide a framework for managing projects from their inception to their
completion. Typically, there are five stages of a project, and various tasks within each stage make up the
project management framework (Figure 9.11). The five stages are as follows:
1.
project initiation
2.
project planning
3.
project execution
4.
monitoring and control
5.
project closure
Figure 9.11 A PMBOK approach shows the five main stages of project management linearly. (attribution: Copyright Rice University,
OpenStax, under CC BY 4.0 license)
The PMBOK defines a comprehensive set of processes that guide project managers through each stage of a
project. Following the processes ensures the project will be on time, be within scope and budget, have minimal
risk, and be of acceptable quality.
Project Initiation
The project initiation stage marks the creation of a project and involves defining its purpose, objectives, and
stakeholders. It’s like creating a road map for a project journey. Most times, projects come from the top down
or bottom up—meaning that they are sometimes initiated by the company’s leadership and sometimes by
managers within the company. The third way a project can be initiated is through a client. For example, your
company may be selling a complex software application that requires the product to be carefully customized
to a client’s operations. This would require a project to be initiated for the purpose of a sale made to a client.
There are many factors that go into how an organization initiates projects and decides how they will be
managed. During the initiation stage, project managers undertake several key activities.
Project Identification and Selection
Project identification entails recognizing opportunities or challenges that warrant a project’s initiation. Projects
346
9 • Information Systems Project Management
Access for free at openstax.org

may be initiated to address market demands, meet organizational goals, or tackle specific problems. Once
identified, potential projects undergo an evaluation based on factors such as strategic alignment, feasibility,
and resource availability. Best practices suggest using methods like cost-benefit analysis, SWOT (strengths,
weaknesses, opportunities, and threats) analysis, or business case development to assess project viability.
Stakeholder Analysis
Understanding stakeholders and their influence is crucial for project success. It is important to understand
that failure to properly identify a key stakeholder can jeopardize an entire project. Project managers employ
techniques like stakeholder mapping and analysis to identify key stakeholders, assess their expectations, and
determine their level of involvement. Stakeholder engagement strategies are formulated to foster effective
communication, collaboration, and stakeholder satisfaction throughout the project life cycle (PLC).
Project Charter Development
The project charter serves as a formal document that authorizes project initiation. Many large organizations
may have a committee or leaders that determine which projects will be authorized to begin the charter
initiation process. The project charter outlines the project’s objectives, scope, constraints, and success criteria.
It also establishes your authority as the project manager and provides a high-level view of the risks and
stakeholders involved. Developing a comprehensive project charter establishes a clear direction for the project
and sets the stage for subsequent project planning activities.
Project Planning
Once your project has kicked off, it’s time to dive into creating a project management plan to ensure project
success. This stage is about defining the project’s scope and the details of how progress will be accomplished.
It is important to note that the scope, schedule, risks, and budget are all part of this stage and set the
parameters for a successful project. A scope document, RACI documents, and project plan for how the project
will be managed should all be considered during this stage.
Scope Definition
The scope includes the deliverables, objectives, and requirements of the project. Defining scope is like drawing
the boundaries of your project. You want to be very clear about what’s included and what’s not. To establish a
clear understanding of what the project entails, project managers employ a statement of work, a document
detailing the requirements, deliverables, schedule, and responsibilities of the stakeholders of a project. Scope
verification and control processes are also put in place to manage changes and ensure alignment with
stakeholder expectations. Control processes mean setting up a change management process to keep track of
the scope and the budget for these changes.
As a project manager, one of your most important jobs is to minimize scope creep, which is where the scope
of the project grows beyond what was agreed on in the planning stage of the project as requirements are
changed or modified down the line. It is a good idea to set up processes to help manage the scope, such as
getting sign-off on a scope document before the project begins and setting up a proper procedure for
stakeholders to change or modify the scope, called a change management process.
Schedule Development
Developing an accurate project schedule involves sequencing project activities, estimating durations, and
creating a timeline (Figure 9.12). Techniques like network diagrams, critical path analysis, and schedule
compression aid in scheduling activities and identifying dependencies. Project managers use scheduling tools
and software to optimize resource utilization, manage project constraints, and mitigate schedule risks.
9.2 • Setting Up and Managing Projects for Success
347

Figure 9.12 Scheduling tools enable project managers and team members to visualize an entire project and understand how each
step in the project coordinates to meet project deadlines, as in this example from a construction project. (credit: “Tasks” by Christine
Nicholas/Flickr, CC BY 2.0)
Resource Planning
The task of determining what resources are needed and when they will be needed is called resource
planning. Project managers assess the availability and capabilities of resources, both human and nonhuman,
to ensure efficient resource utilization. By considering factors such as resource skill sets, costs, and
constraints, project managers develop resource management plans that align with project objectives.
Budgeting and Cost Management
Effective cost management ensures that projects stay within budget constraints. Project managers estimate
costs, create budgets, and monitor expenditures against actual project costs. Techniques such as cost
estimation, cost aggregation, and earned value management aid in budget development and cost control.
The planning stage is a perfect point in the project to ensure that you understand the PMO’s or the company’s
escalation policies. Project managers use the PMO or company policies to decide when to escalate project
overruns that can negatively impact the project. An escalation policy determines when the project manager
should report budget issues, such as being under or over budget. Some projects may have specifications
dictating that when projects are under budget, the client receives the excess portion to make additional
changes later in the project or receives that money back on future payments. Think of a project like going on a
weekend trip where your parent gives you a set amount of money to spend on the trip. They may say you can
spend up to that amount, but if you don’t spend it all, you can’t keep the change, and if you go over that
amount, it comes out of your pocket. This is why project managers need to be good at budgeting and
managing costs on projects. Knowing the company’s policies and the client’s requirements is key to
successfully managing budget and costs.
Project Execution
With a plan in place, it’s time to execute. This is where all the action happens. The project manager monitors
progress, addresses issues as they arise, and ensures the project stays on track. The project execution stage
involves implementing the project plan, managing resources, and monitoring progress. This stage focuses on
coordinated effort and effective communication. This might be the shortest phase as far as the number of
tasks to complete, but the work has just begun. The project manager goes from planning to executing the
plans, which include a lot of other human beings and resources that need to be monitored.
During project execution, project managers oversee the execution of planned activities, ensuring that work is
performed in accordance with the project plan. This includes coordinating resources, managing risks, resolving
348
9 • Information Systems Project Management
Access for free at openstax.org

issues, and ensuring quality control. Effective leadership and stakeholder engagement are critical in fostering
collaboration and maintaining project momentum. This is the stage at which communication becomes critical.
You might have leaders and supervisors who have never worked together before or never worked with you.
Set expectations and make sure everyone knows their job for the project.
Monitoring and Control
Continuous monitoring and control are vital to tracking project performance and ensuring adherence to the
project plan, all in service to ensuring a successful end project. Project managers employ techniques such as
progress tracking, performance measurements, and variance analysis to assess project status. Key
performance indicators are established to monitor project objectives, deliverables, and milestones. Timely
identification of deviations enables project managers to take corrective actions, adjust plans, and manage
project changes.
The project manager may take on several different roles during this stage. They are leaders, managers,
accountants, and human resources experts; they may also be technical experts depending on their
backgrounds. Project managers must anticipate, imagine, adjust, fix, and stay on top of everything related to
their project. If a project manager has a good team to work with, this part can be easy, but if the project
manager’s team develops conflicts, this could mean a delay in deliverables or failure to deliver the right
product or service.
Part of monitoring and control and the planning stages is risk management. Identifying, analyzing, and
responding to risks is crucial to project success; thus, risk management is one of the most important jobs of
the project manager. The process of risk management encompasses risk identification, qualitative and
quantitative analysis, risk response planning, and risk monitoring and control. By actively managing risks
throughout the PLC, project managers enhance project resilience and minimize negative impacts.
Project Closure
The project closure stage brings the project to a formal conclusion, ensuring that all project objectives are
met and deliverables are handed over. This is the stage at which team members return to their previous work,
or they move on to the next project. This is not true for the project manager. The project manager must
complete all the paperwork and ensure the client or customer is happy with the outcome of the project.
Project managers will ensure they met the budget or even came in under budget numbers, and the timeline
would be verified to ensure that the project was delivered within the timeline agreed on by the client.
Deliverable Acceptance
One of the important items on a project manager’s closeout checklist should be the acceptance of deliverables.
At this point in the process, project managers verify that the deliverables have been assessed and that all
deliverables meet the scope and stakeholder requirements of the project. Formal acceptance procedures and
sign-offs are obtained to confirm the satisfactory completion of deliverables. Best practices recommend
involving stakeholders in the acceptance process to validate deliverable quality and promote customer
satisfaction.
Project Evaluation: Knowledge Transfer and Documentation
Postproject evaluation assesses the project’s overall performance, including its success in meeting objectives,
adherence to schedule and budget, and stakeholder satisfaction. Evaluation findings contribute to
organizational learning, enabling improvements in future project management processes and practices. As the
project concludes, knowledge transfer takes place to capture lessons learned and share best practices.
Documentation of project artifacts, reports, and records facilitates knowledge retention and supports future
projects. Project managers conduct project reviews and retrospective meetings to analyze project
performance, identify areas for improvement, and enhance organizational learning. Usually, the PMO or
another project manager would conduct an audit of the project and survey stakeholders on how to improve
9.2 • Setting Up and Managing Projects for Success
349

projects in the future. This information is collected and utilized to help PMOs change processes or policies to
operate more efficiently. Some organizations may not have one electronic area within which to keep all of their
project data, so it is important the project manager takes time to organize the knowledge and safely keep the
data where it can be accessed for the next projects.
Developing a Project Management Plan and Schedule
To ensure successful project execution, project managers should develop a comprehensive project plan and
schedule using real requirements and documentation. This phase involves several key steps, each of which
plays a significant role in shaping the project’s direction and facilitating efficient execution.
Defining Project Objectives
The first thing the project manager must do is clearly articulate the project’s objectives and desired outcomes.
This involves engaging stakeholders and understanding their expectations for the project and the deliverables.
It is essential to establish SMART (specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound) objectives to
provide a clear direction for the project. Without this step, you can get to the end of the project and find the
client is unhappy.
Identifying Deliverables
The project manager must identify with the stakeholders, including the client, specific deliverables the project
will produce, including reporting and any other updating the stakeholders need. These deliverables can be
tangible products, services, or outcomes that contribute to the project’s success. By identifying and defining
deliverables, the project team gains a shared understanding of what needs to be accomplished.
Defining Scope
As you learned, the project scope defines the boundaries of the project, including what is included and what is
excluded. A well-defined scope helps manage expectations, prevent scope creep, and ensure that the project
remains focused on its intended outcomes. The project manager must also clearly document the project scope
statement to provide a reference point throughout the project and ensure that the product and/or service
being delivered meets stakeholder expectations as defined in the scope.
Work Breakdown Structure
A work breakdown structure (WBS) helps the project manager understand how the deliverables will be
scheduled and any dependencies there might be in completing other deliverables, essentially breaking down
the work into smaller, more manageable work packages and tasks. A WBS allows the project manager to see
the project as bite-sized pieces and tackle them one by one. For example, if you have one team that needs to
produce two deliverables, you may need to resource the first deliverable or divide the team if there are
enough individuals to complete both deliverables on time. A WBS provides a structured view of the project’s
tasks, activities, and subactivities, using some of these techniques:
•
Activity sequencing: A WBS can identify logical dependencies between project activities to determine
which activities must be completed before others can begin and establish the sequence in which activities
should be executed. Dependency relationships can be of various types, including finish-to-start, start-to-
start, finish-to-finish, and start-to-finish. This step helps in determining the flow of tasks and
understanding the project timeline.
•
Estimating activity durations: Accurate duration estimates help in creating a realistic project schedule. To
estimate the time required to complete each activity, the project manager must consider resource
availability, complexity, and dependencies. The project manager can use historical data or expert
judgment if they have the experience. There are several estimation techniques that would be taught in a
project management course or training, such as analogous estimating, parametric estimating, and three-
point estimating to determine activity durations.
•
Resource planning: The project manager needs to identify the resources required to execute the project
350
9 • Information Systems Project Management
Access for free at openstax.org

activities as well as assess the availability and allocation of resources. This requires a solid estimation of
the team’s skills, expertise, and availability throughout the project. Resources could include human
resources, equipment, materials, and any other necessary assets. Good resource planning ensures that
the right resources are assigned to the right tasks at the right time.
Developing the Schedule
Using the activity durations, dependencies, and resource planning, the project manager can create a project
schedule. The schedule outlines the start and end dates for each activity and provides a road map for project
execution. The project manager also considers constraints, milestones, and critical path analysis to ensure that
the schedule reflects realistic timelines and dependencies.
Monitoring and Control
When the project is ready to move along with its tasks, the project manager must establish processes and
tools for monitoring the project’s progress and managing any deviations from the planned schedule. The
project manager must regularly track the actual progress against the planned schedule, identify variations,
and take corrective actions as necessary, sometimes in a very short period of time. The project manager also
needs to conduct regular project status meetings, update the project plan and schedule, and communicate
changes to stakeholders. This is one of the busiest times for a project manager.
ETHICS IN IS
The Ethics Guy Podcast
Project managers need to make decisions on a regular basis that impact the project from an ethical
perspective. This podcast episode specifically tackles project manager ethics (https://openstax.org/r/
109PMEthics) and features Bruce Weinstein, “The Ethics Guy,” discussing what a project manager should do
and whom they should be. The podcast Manage This is directed at project managers as they make
important decisions not just for projects, but also for organizations, which involve resources, budgets, and
leadership skills.
The Plan and Schedule in Action
To illustrate the importance of project planning and scheduling, consider a scenario of developing a new
software application. Imagine you are a project manager responsible for overseeing the software development
life cycle, from inception to deployment, at a high-tech firm that sells IT services to small- and medium-sized
organizations. Your organization has recognized the need for a customer relationship management (CRM)
system to enhance customer interactions and streamline business processes.
To effectively support the sales and customer management processes of a medium-sized organization that
sells search engine optimization (SEO) services to large organizations, the CRM system your organization
needs encompasses a range of specific requirements. These requirements are tailored to the organization’s
unique needs and the nature of the services it provides, such as reviewing SEO data to determine gaps in web
strategy.
The first thing you must do is accurately identify stakeholders in the project to ensure they are represented in
the requirements gathering process. Once the stakeholders are identified, you can set up the processes for
how to gather the needs and wants of the team and the organization. For example, should you have one big
meeting, or should you break down various groups by function and meet with them separately? Or should you
select certain individuals to be part of one higher-level meeting and then have others be part of another broad
meeting to gather requirements?
As a project manager, the hardest part of the requirements gathering process is determining the difference
9.2 • Setting Up and Managing Projects for Success
351

between a “must-have” (needed) feature or function and one that is “nice to have” (wanted). Identifying both
the needs and wants in the requirements is necessary when budgeting and designing the solution. If there is
money left in the budget, you may be able to deliver on some of the wants instead of just the must-have
features and functionality.
Table 9.1 outlines the key requirements for the CRM system gathered through stakeholder meetings and
analysis of the future needs of the organization for this scenario.

Table 9.1 Sample Requirements Documentation A requirements document for selling SEO services might begin with something
like this example.
These requirements will be documented in the requirements document that eventually will become the scope
of the project. Project managers need to have this requirements document to determine the solution, budget,
and timeline for the project.
Developing a well-structured project plan and schedule is critical to ensure a successful CRM software
implementation. The project plan outlines the entire scope of work, including the specific deliverables,
milestones, and activities required to complete the project. It serves as a road map, guiding the project team
through the various phases of development, testing, and deployment.
Planning for the Solution
The next step in developing the project plan and schedule is to understand the solution or how the
organization will go about finding the right solution. The solution can be developed in one of two ways: (1) use
the requirements document to draft a request for proposal (RFP) to acquire vendors who can supply or build
the solution or (2) determine the internal and external resources needed to build the solution and integrate it
into the organization. Depending on the resources of the organization, it may be better to select a vendor who
can deliver an off-the-shelf CRM system and integrate it with the internal organization. For the purposes of this
scenario, a vendor will deliver the complete solution.
Project Objectives
In this case, the organization has defined the objectives to include improving customer satisfaction, increasing
operational efficiency, and boosting sales revenue. These clearly defined objectives provide direction for the
project and align the efforts of the project team with the organization’s strategic goals.
Deliverables
Since the organization is choosing an off-the-shelf solution and will have a vendor implement and integrate
the CRM solution, the project manager’s deliverable is an RFP with the requirements categorized and defined,
such as customer data management, sales pipeline tracking, and reporting functionalities. Under each of
these categories, the actual requirements would be written to include in the RFP.
Next comes the selection process. The project manager will need to develop the criteria and process for the
selection of the vendor. This information will become part of the RFP, so vendors know what to expect. For
example, you may require the vendor to submit a proposal and a detailed demonstration of the features and
functionalities requested in the requirements. Or you may require the vendor to submit their proposal in
person as a presentation to key stakeholders.
9.2 • Setting Up and Managing Projects for Success

Last, you will need to detail the transition and management plan for the project. This plan describes how the
organization will work with the vendor and who the key points of contact would be. Typically this includes the
project manager and, depending on the questions the vendor may have about the specifics of the project,
perhaps someone from the organization’s leadership team or technical department.
Scope
Once the objectives and deliverables are defined, the project manager proceeds with scoping the project.
Determining the boundaries of the project involves establishing what is within the project’s scope and what is
not. Scoping this project should be simple since you are selecting a CRM vendor who will provide a solution
and integrate it into your organization. As a member of the company acquiring the software, all you must
manage is the RFP process and how you will work with the vendor to implement the solution. The vendor
should provide its own project manager to work with you.
Creating a Work Breakdown Structure
With the scope defined, the project manager then creates a WBS (Figure 9.13). In the case of the CRM software
development, the WBS could include activities such as requirements gathering, system design, coding, testing,
user training, and deployment. The WBS breaks down what needs to be part of the schedule and estimates
how long each task might take. Earlier the work was defined as follows:
•
initiating the project
•
acquiring the project requirements
•
developing the RFP
•
selecting the vendor
•
overseeing the vendor’s implementation, integration, and training services
First, organize these master tasks across the top of the WBS. Under each master task, break down the task into
smaller tasks and organize those accordingly.

Sequencing
Once the WBS is established, the project manager can identify the dependencies between activities and
establish the sequence in which they should be executed. Sequence these subtasks for each master task and
assign the number of work hours it will take to complete each task. For instance, system design cannot begin
until the requirement’s gathering phase is completed. This activity sequencing ensures a logical flow of work
and enables efficient resource allocation. Remember that your WBS will help you understand the
dependencies of each task and the flow of the project and help determine the time each task will take to be
completed.
To estimate the duration of each activity, consider various factors such as resource availability, complexity, and
dependencies. For example, acquiring the project requirements may take a while because this task is
dependent on the schedule of the stakeholders involved and the approval process required.
Next identify the resources required to carry out the project activities. This could include software developers,
testers, and database administrators, as well as infrastructure resources for this project. Ensuring that the
right resources are allocated to the right tasks at the right time is essential for maintaining project efficiency.
Bringing It All Together
Once the project plan is developed, the project manager will go to the calendar and begin using the WBS to
turn the sequencing, resource allocations, and durations for each task into a project schedule. The schedule
outlines the start and end dates for each activity, considering the estimated durations, dependencies, and
resource availability. It provides a clear timeline for the project team and stakeholders, facilitating coordination
and ensuring everyone is aware of key milestones and deadlines.
FUTURE TECHNOLOGY
Using Artificial Intelligence or GPT for Project Management
Both AI and GPT are big in the business industry. How can project managers use GPT to assist in their work
activities? Well, let’s ask Bing GPT, which was running on GPT Version 4 at the time this was written. In
answer to this question, Bing GPT provided some very interesting information and an interesting
recommendation.
Hello, this is Bing. I’m glad you asked. AI or GPT can help with project management in many ways,
such as:
•
Creating project plans and timelines by providing information on your assignment and getting
suggestions from ChatGPT, an AI tool that uses machine learning to generate natural language
responses.
•
Getting feedback or optimization tips on your existing project plans or timelines by asking ChatGPT
questions and getting in-depth answers.
•
Delegating tasks to your team members by providing ChatGPT with the scope of the project and
the strengths and weaknesses of each team member, then asking who should take on which task.
•
Boosting productivity and improving project workflows by using AI-powered solutions that can
automate task creation, provide PM insights, and handle uncertainty and risk.
However, there are also some limitations and challenges of using AI or GPT for project
management, such as:
•
Lack of context or expertise in certain areas or industries, which may lead to weak or inaccurate
recommendations.
•
Difficulty in dealing with complex or ambiguous situations that require human judgment or

creativity.
•
Ethical or legal issues that may arise from using AI-generated content or data without proper
attribution or consent.
It is important that, if used, AI or GPT serve as a supportive tool rather than a replacement for human
project managers. You should always verify the quality and validity of any AI-generated content or data
before using it for a project. You should also be aware of the ethical and legal implications of using AI or
GPT for project management and follow the best practices and guidelines for responsible AI use.
Project Risks
Risk assessment and management are important in today’s business world. In project management, effective
risk assessment is crucial for managing successful project outcomes. Identifying, evaluating, and mitigating
project risks are essential processes that help managers project, anticipate, and address potential obstacles
that can impact project objectives.
Risk management is something people can use in every part of life, so the risk assessment described here can
be applied to other activities, such as buying a car or getting a job, to determine what the impact of those risks
would be on your life financially, time-wise, or in any other way.
Identifying Risks
The first step in a risk assessment is to define what a risk is and how it should be categorized. A risk is an
event or condition that has a negative effect should it occur during a project. Identifying project risks involves
systematically identifying potential events or circumstances that may have an adverse impact on project
objectives. Project risks should be identified throughout the project and monitored for severity. Each time
there is a delay in a deliverable, the chance of completing the project on time could become a risk or impact on
the cost or budget of the project. There are various strategies for identifying risks in a project.
Engaging Stakeholders
Stakeholders possess valuable knowledge and perspectives on different aspects of the project that you may
not have or that they are more familiar with. By involving stakeholders in risk identification activities, project
managers can tap into their expertise and gain a comprehensive understanding of potential risks. Here are
some tips on engaging stakeholders1 :
•
Brainstorming sessions: Organize brainstorming sessions with the project team, subject matter experts,
and relevant stakeholders. It is the project manager’s job to encourage participants to freely express their
thoughts and ideas about potential risks. This collaborative approach fosters creativity and allows for the
identification of risks from diverse viewpoints.
•
Interviews and workshops: Conducting interviews or workshops with key stakeholders can elicit their
insights on risks specific to their areas of expertise. These interactions provide an opportunity to explore
risks associated with project requirements, technology, resources, and external factors.
Utilizing Risk Identification Techniques
In addition to stakeholder engagement, various techniques can be employed to systematically identify project
risks2 :
•
Checklists: A favorite among project managers, checklists that cover a wide range of risk categories
relevant to the project can serve as prompts to stimulate thinking and ensure comprehensive risk
identification. Examples of checklists include industry-specific risk checklists, lessons learned from

previous projects, or risk categories derived from standards and best practices. The key is not to reinvent a
process but to use the resources you already have available. The PMI provides several resources for risk
assessment documents.
•
Historical information review: Before you begin to gather risk data, analyze historical project data, lessons
learned, and postmortem reports from previous projects to identify risks encountered in similar contexts.
This technique leverages the experience and knowledge gained from past projects to proactively identify
risks that may arise in the current project. Look for prior risk assessment documents from similar projects
and determine if this project could encounter the same types of risks.
•
Cause-and-effect analysis: Apply cause-and-effect analysis techniques, such as fishbone (Ishikawa)
diagrams (Figure 9.14) or the five-whys technique, to identify potential risks by exploring the underlying
causes. This technique helps uncover risks that may not be immediately apparent and enables a deeper
understanding of their root causes.
•
SWOT analysis: A SWOT analysis is used in business for determining new strategies and developing new
products. The SWOT analysis identifies risks related to the project’s internal and external environment and
helps identify potential threats and weaknesses that may impact the project’s success.
•
Expert judgment: More experienced project managers have a lot of history with various types of projects
and can readily identify risks. Junior project managers should seek input from subject matter experts or
experienced professionals who possess domain-specific knowledge. Their expertise can help the project
manager identify risks that may be unique to the project domain or require specialized insights.

adjustments needed to the project, schedule, or budget. (attribution: Copyright Rice University, OpenStax, under CC BY 4.0 license)
Evaluating Risks
Once risks are identified, they must be evaluated for their impact, probability, and severity related to the
project. To evaluate risks of the project, conduct an overall risk assessment (Figure 9.15). The risk assessment
provides the team with an overall level of risk or risk exposure number and takes into consideration any
threats to the project, including its budget, scope, quality, and schedule. For example, it would consider what
would happen if the budget were depleted or if a natural disaster occurred.

Figure 9.15 A risk assessment matrix can help project managers determine the level of impact of a risk by accounting for its
probability and severity. (attribution: Copyright Rice University, OpenStax, under CC BY 4.0 license)
For easy evaluation, the impact of a risk can be sorted across categories, such as the range from least to most
in Figure 9.15. The likelihood of a risk (for example, an earthquake on the East Coast of the United States)
happening is called the probability, which ranges from least to most. An earthquake on the East Coast of the
United States has a least probability because history tells us this does not happen very often. The severity of
the impact of a risk on a project’s cost, schedule, scope, and quality is also measured from least to most. A risk
register documents the risk to the project being completed within budget, on time, within scope, with good
quality, and with minimal risks. Figure 9.16 shows how a risk could be ranked. The project manager would then
determine if the risk must be accepted or mitigated—or if it is so great that the project should be canceled.
Figure 9.16 As part of a risk assessment, a project manager would use a matrix to determine the risk level of a project and record
the risks using a risk register. (attribution: Copyright Rice University, OpenStax, under CC BY 4.0 license)
The project manager assesses the probability and impact of risks with respect to the project. This is a hard
task, especially for those lacking history or experience in this area or knowledge of disaster events like
earthquakes. Here are some tips and a breakdown of the process to use when assessing the probability and
impact of risks on your project3 :
•
Probability assessment: Evaluate the likelihood of each identified risk event happening. This can be done
qualitatively by assigning probabilities (low, medium, high) or quantitatively by using historical data or
statistical analysis to estimate the probability. The probability will be expressed as a percentage.
•
Impact assessment: Determine the potential consequences or impact that each risk event can have on the
project, such as scope, schedule, budget, quality, and stakeholders. Assess the weight of these impacts

based on their severity and significance to the project. For example, if a project that is to be undertaken in
a war zone or during the monsoon season, there will likely be some major risks to the project both in
completing the project and in protecting the human resources who are performing the tasks on the
project.
•
Prioritizing risks: Prioritize risks based on their significance to the project. Prioritization will help you
allocate resources so you can focus on managing the most critical risks. Known as risk scoring or ranking,
the project manager assigns scores or ranks to each risk based on its evaluated probability and impact.
For example, consider a project located in the polar ice caps during the winter season. The risk of getting
enough goods and materials to this region is high in the coldest part of winter. This might be ranked as a
high risk. Various techniques, such as risk matrixes, decision trees, or multicriteria decision analysis, can
help evaluate these risks. The higher the score or rank, the greater the priority of the risk.
•
Consideration of project objectives: Take into account the project’s specific goals, constraints, and
priorities when prioritizing risks. Some risks may be more critical to achieving project success, while others
may have a lower impact on overall objectives. An example would be a slowdown in the supply of
materials to complete a project, such as silicon chips due to a major pandemic, or finding human
resources to complete the project. The project would fail without either of these resources, so the project
manager must plan for these obstacles and ensure there is time in the schedule to overcome or mitigate
these risks.
•
Review and refinement: Always regularly review and refine the prioritization of risks as new information
becomes available or project circumstances change. This is critical because risks and situations can
change frequently. For example, you could be at the end of a project when you realize your team doesn’t
have a certain kind of tool to finish the highly technical assembly of some part. To help prepare for this,
reassess the priority of risks at key project milestones or decision points to ensure that risk management
remains aligned with project needs.
Risk evaluation is an ongoing process that requires continuous monitoring and review throughout the PLC.
Following are some simple ways to continuously evaluate risks:
•
Continuous monitoring: Continuously monitor the status of identified risks and track any changes in their
probability or impact. Conduct regular risk assessments, status updates, and progress reports, and obtain
stakeholder feedback.
•
Periodic reviews: If you have a project that doesn’t have very many high-level risks, you might be able to
conduct periodic risk assessments to reassess the evaluated risks and their prioritization. Along with this,
review the effectiveness of existing risk mitigation measures and identify any new risks that may have
emerged.
•
Adjustments and updates: If you evaluate and measure each new development as it comes into the
project, you likely encounter adjustments and updates. For example, maybe you have a change order. This
would be a good time to adjust the risk assessment. You would adjust risk evaluations and priorities based
on the current situation and any new project developments, and you would update risk response
strategies, mitigation plans, and contingency measures to address any changes in the risk landscape.
Mitigating Risks
Mitigating project risks is a crucial aspect of risk management. It involves taking proactive measures to reduce
the probability and impact of the risks that have been identified and evaluated. For example, suppose a project
involves doing construction work during the monsoon season in Africa. Since there is very little rain in parts of
Africa at most times, the project team might be able to mitigate this risk by scheduling around the monsoon
season. Some risks may not be as easy to mitigate. In those cases, the project manager, along with the
organization’s leadership, will need to determine how much risk the organization is willing to accept on the
project. There are several strategies that can help project managers enhance their ability to navigate potential
obstacles and improve project outcomes.
9.2 • Setting Up and Managing Projects for Success
359

Developing Risk Response Strategies
Once a project manager has identified and evaluated the risks associated with a project, the next step is to
develop risk response strategies. These strategies define the actions to be taken in response to specific risks:
•
Avoidance: Identify risks that can be completely avoided by taking specific actions. You cannot avoid all
risks, but if you can, do so. For example, if a project is at risk of exceeding the budget due to scope creep,
establishing strict change control processes can help avoid unnecessary scope changes.
•
Transfer: If you cannot avoid a risk, then consider risks that can be transferred to external parties. This can
be achieved through contractual agreements, insurance policies, or outsourcing certain project activities
to specialized vendors or partners.
•
Mitigation: If other steps fail, implement measures to reduce the probability or impact of the risks. This
may involve implementing additional quality control processes, conducting regular inspections, or
enhancing project team skills through training.
•
Acceptance: If a risk cannot be avoided, transferred, or mitigated, accept the risk and prepare for any
consequences. Acceptance involves acknowledging the risk and its potential impact while developing
contingency plans to address any adverse effects.
Implementing Risk Mitigation Measures
Implementing mitigation measures ensures that the identified risks are effectively addressed. The project
manager would need to be sure that all stakeholders are aware of the risks and that the individuals
responsible for mitigation measures are involved in the risk process. Clearly define roles and responsibilities
for implementing risk mitigation measures. Assign specific team members or stakeholders to oversee the
execution of mitigation actions. The project manager could do this, but it is most likely that another team
member or leadership can resolve the issues. The project manager would still need to follow up and ensure
the risk is mitigated to everyone’s satisfaction.
Next, develop a contingency plan. Identify potential fallback options or contingency plans to address risks that
cannot be completely mitigated. A contingency plan outlines the actions the project manager would take if
the risky event occurred, allowing for a quick and efficient response. Some companies may already have
responses to these risks in their overall operations plan. Be sure that all stakeholders, including members of
the leadership team, clients, and others, are aware of contingency plans. Communication is key in risk
management, and when risk occurs, it can play a role in whether the end result is a successful project or one
that goes wrong.
Finally, monitor and track the risks to be sure to mitigate them in the future. Continuous monitoring is needed
to measure the effectiveness of the mitigation plan. Regularly track the status of risks, assessing whether the
planned actions are reducing the probability or impact as intended.
Regularly Reviewing and Reassessing
Risk reviews are an ongoing process. It is important to adapt and refine mitigation strategies as circumstances
continuously change. As a project manager, it is your job to ensure that these risks are constantly being
reviewed and reassessed. Besides doing periodic reviews, focus on lessons learned from other projects where
similar risks may have occurred. If you can capture and document these risks during a lesson learned, it could
save you a lot of time and money on newer projects. Review your own projects’ risks from previous projects
and see how these risks impacted your project and then determine if there would have been a different
solution that you could have applied. Regardless of the process or methodology you choose, you must stay on
top of managing risks so your project goes as smoothly as possible.

Project Management in Finance
The financial industry also employs many different graduates from all types of background and degree
programs. The financial industry is vast and ranges from small-town banks to large global investment firms.
Depending on your expertise, experience, and the specific needs of the organization, you will find that project
managers are paid very well in this industry. Following are some of the project manager positions in the
financial industry:
•
Banking project manager: Like a health-care project manager in health care, this is a general project
management position responsible for overseeing and managing projects across different areas of the

initiatives, and data privacy regulations. In these positions, a project manager would need to have a
background in regulatory matters and compliance in the financial industry.
•
Product development project manager: Banks continuously develop and launch new products and services
to meet customer demands. Product development project managers lead development initiatives of new
products and could oversee a portfolio of projects in the development area. Usually these project
managers collaborate with cross-functional teams to ensure successful product delivery. This is a great
position for a project manager who is very creative and likes to be on the cutting edge of product
development.
•
Merger and acquisition project manager: In the financial industry, mergers, acquisitions, and integrations
are common. Usually there is a separate merger and acquisition department that handles the merger and
acquisition of companies interested in buying or investing in other companies. Usually, these positions are
found in large investment brokerage companies that solely manage mergers and acquisitions. Project
managers specializing in this area perform due diligence, integration planning, systems consolidation, and
cultural alignment tasks. This is a very interesting career for someone who likes to work across various
industries.
The financial industry can be a very exciting and lucrative career for anyone who studies business and project
management. Even if you don’t enjoy math or accounting, a project manager can still be successfully employed
in the financial industry.
Project Management in Manufacturing
You may find yourself in a manufacturing industry where administrative and technical jobs are the focus, but

Characteristics of Project Managers
Project managers possess a range of characteristics that contribute to their success in leading projects. Here
are some characteristics typical of successful project managers:5
•
Leadership: As a project manager, you need strong leadership skills to guide teams, to inspire, collaborate,
and motivate individuals to achieve project goals. You must also be able to provide clear direction,
delegate tasks, and foster a positive and productive work environment.
•
Communication: Effective communication is necessary for project managers to convey information, set
expectations, and facilitate effective collaboration among team members, stakeholders, and clients.
Project managers are skilled in active listening and clear verbal and written communication and are able
to adapt their communication style to different audiences.
•
Organizational skills: Project managers must be highly organized to handle multiple tasks, deadlines, and
resources effectively. Project managers develop detailed project plans, establish timelines, allocate
resources, and track progress to ensure projects stay on track and within budget.
•
Problem-solving skills: Project managers encounter various challenges throughout projects. You should
possess strong problem-solving skills to identify issues, analyze root causes, and develop effective
solutions. You should be proactive in mitigating risks, handling conflicts, and making timely decisions to
keep projects on course.
•
Adaptability: Projects often require flexibility and adaptability as circumstances change. You can expect
that all projects have their challenges, and you need to think fast and adapt to those changes. Project
managers can adjust their plans, resources, and strategies to accommodate unforeseen challenges or
shifting priorities.
•
Collaboration: Even though the project manager has a lot of control and authority, a project manager is
part of a team aiming to get projects completed through collaboration. Project managers work with cross-
functional teams, stakeholders, and external partners. A project manager needs to excel in building
relationships, fostering collaboration, and promoting teamwork.
•
Time management: Managing your time and your team’s time is a priority for project managers. Project
managers are adept at managing time efficiently. They prioritize tasks, set realistic deadlines, and ensure
project milestones are achieved on time.
Many of these characteristics are soft skills required of any career. Colleges and universities pay close attention
to developing these skills in their students. Characteristics like leadership, collaboration, and time
management are all key skills for project managers and are taught in any project manager program.
Developing foundational skills is a good way to achieve success as a project manager. You may discover you
are very good at these skills already, and you don’t have to wait to practice them. Try applying budgeting,

scheduling, and time management skills into your daily life. Seek out internships to get experience. Sign up to
run a project for a student organization or take on a leadership role and focus on managing the organization
and projects using best practices and skills you learned in your studies. Always seek out opportunities for
teamwork and collaboration no matter where you are in life or where you may find the opportunities.
Education and Certifications to Become a Project Manager
A specific degree is not required but having some courses or training in project management or a related field
can be advantageous. Pursuing a bachelor’s or master’s degree in fields such as business administration,
engineering, computer science, or project management can provide an understanding of the principles and
fundamentals of project management. Courses in specialty areas like IS offer opportunities to learn about
project management methodologies, tools, and best practices through case studies and group projects.
Project management certifications can enhance your credentials and earning power, as well as demonstrate
your commitment to the field. The PMP certification, offered by the PMI, is one of the most recognized and
respected certifications in the industry. To earn the PMP certification, you need a combination of education
and project management experience, along with passing the PMP certification exam. If you don’t have enough
experience to get the PMP certification, which requires three to five years of demonstrated project
management work, you may want to consider a CAPM certification, which only requires two years of
demonstrated experience in project management. Having demonstrated experience in project management
doesn’t mean you have to have held the title of a project manager, only that you have performed various tasks
in project manager task areas like initiating, managing, and closing projects. Both PMP and CAPM
certifications require an individual to have a fixed number of hours of training before taking the exam, and
they also require continuous professional development and ongoing training to maintain both certifications.
PRINCE2 certification can also be pursued to showcase your knowledge and skills in project management. It
also requires demonstrated experience in project management, an exam, and continuous professional
development.
Many project management positions will require some sort of certification. To obtain the best credentials in
project management and earn the most in salary for the job, you will likely need a PMP certification or a
certification in a specific Agile project management area like Scrum Master or PRINCE2.
Project management is forever evolving, and staying updated with the latest trends, methodologies, and tools
is important to maintain your certification and your expertise. As you complete college or training, you should
think of learning as a lifelong endeavor. New technologies, new tools, and new best practices are progressing
at a faster rate than ever before. Adopting a mindset of continuous learning and professional development is a
must for long-term growth and sustainability. Attending industry conferences, workshops, and seminars, as
well as engaging in online resources, webinars, and reading project management publications are all methods
of continuous learning. Joining professional organizations and networking groups is a great way to connect
with experienced project managers and learn from their experiences.
