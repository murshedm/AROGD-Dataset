Chapter 3 – Continuous Assessment of Decarbonization Improvements
3.1 Lifecycle Assessment and Techno-Economic Assessment
Lifecycle assessment (LCA) and techno-economic assessment (TEA) are often part of the validation 
for proposals of technologies aimed at reducing CO2 emissions of industries, and carbon capture and 
utilization technologies are part of decarbonization options considered. When introducing new technology 
to reduce CO2 emission, lower energy consumption, or capture and utilize carbon, it is imperative to perform 
LCA and TEA to ascertain the value added from the new technology or process change introduced. LCA 
aims to track the global environmental impacts of the production, use, and disposal of the product or service. 
TEA assesses the economic viability of the technology and is a tool for making decisions on research, 
development, investments, and policy.
Challenges with assessing technologies in their early stages result in an escalation of assessment efforts 
and potential mismatches of research results with the needs of stakeholders. To address this, [51] presented 
the best practices for adapting assessment methodologies to the technology readiness level (TRL) of the 
technology when assessing early-stage climate change mitigation CCU technologies. The authors advocate 
for meeting stakeholders’ needs by aligning TEA/LCA goals and scope with TRL rather than commercial 
interests, estimating missing data using standard estimation tools, and evaluating and communicating 
uncertainties in the assessment. They also recommend collaboration across technology developers and 
TEA/LCA practitioners as a workaround for coping with limited resources. With consensus on 
technological measures for decarbonization, industry watchers advocate for coupling effective policy with 
a body of research on technical solutions to cement and concrete decarbonization [52]. More decisive policy 
actions will help promote the adoption of technological measures to decarbonize the cement industry. In 
addition, cement producers would benefit from a systematic way to continuously monitor and report the 
environmental impact of production processes to validate compliance with decarbonization policies as they 
adopt these technological measures.
25
The LCA and TEA in this study analyze emission and cost reduction opportunities from alternative 
manufacturing inputs in four different scenarios at a US cement plant. In addition, the study demonstrates 
a practical approach to integrating sustainability into cement manufacturing with a deployment framework 
for the continuous assessment of cement production's economic and environmental performance.
3.2 Materials and Methods
Digitalization and data-driven process optimization of cement manufacturing will help the industry 
better manage energy consumption and reduce emissions and raw material inefficiencies [17,53]. There has 
been improvement in sensors, data management, related IoT toolkits, and increased maturity levels of 
artificial intelligence. These, and the templatization of lifecycle and techno-economic assessments, all 
contribute to a deployment framework for continuously assessing the economic and environmental impact 
of process improvements in cement manufacturing.
Advancing innovative near-zero emission production routes, and promoting material efficiency, are two 
of the key carbon-cutting strategies that would contribute the most to direct emission reductions in the Net 
Zero Scenario [24]. Near zero or net zero emission production of cement would require incorporating 
carbon capture in the production process, thereby increasing the cost of production. However, significant 
carbon emission reduction is possible by promoting material efficiency. This study explores material 
efficiency options in demonstrating the deployment framework using the Union Bridge, Maryland plant of 
Lehigh Cement (LC) as a case study. Heidelberg Cement of Germany wholly owns LC and has affiliations 
with technically advanced cement operations and construction-related materials activities. LC’s original 
plant was built in 1910 and has since undergone several modernizations, including replacing four long-dry 
kilns with one preheater/pre-calciner kiln system. At the time of this study, the LC plant in Union Bridge, 
Maryland, is transitioning from producing ordinary Portland cement to Portland-limestone cement, which 
uses innovative technology to increase limestone content and reduce clinker used. The product called 
EcoCemPLC contains as much as 10% more limestone but performs equivalent to ordinary Portland 
cement in concrete compressive, flexural strength, and durability [54]. 
26
To demonstrate how the deployment framework can be leveraged for the continuous assessment and 
improvement of cement production's economic and environmental impact, we review its production at the 
LC plant in Union Bridge under four scenarios, as listed in Table 2 below.
Table 2. Cement production scenarios modeled
# Scenario Product Thermal Energy
1. OPC + Coal Ordinary Portland Cement Coal
2. PLC + Coal Portland-Limestone Cement Coal
3. OPC + DBS Ordinary Portland Cement Dried Biosolids
4. PLC + DBS Portland-Limestone Cement Dried Biosolids
In the first two scenarios, thermal energy for producing ordinary Portland cement and Portlandlimestone cement is provided by coal combustion. In comparison, in the other two scenarios, thermal energy 
is provided by the combustion of dried biosolids from processed sewage sludge. These scenarios were 
examined using the templates developed by the University of Michigan Global CO2 Initiative [55].
3.2.1 Lifecycle Assessment (LCA)
The international standard ISO 14040 defined LCA as a study of environmental and other potential 
impacts throughout a product's life. The product's life, often called ‘cradle-to-grave,' includes raw material 
acquisition, production, use, and disposal. Environmental impacts include resource use, human health, and 
ecological consequences [56]. A detailed assessment of the whole life of a product that serves as an input 
in another product can be complicated. As a result, many researchers in practice limit the LCA to the use 
phase, often called 'cradle-to-gate.' The concept of LCA is based on a simplified system analysis. Therefore, 
meaningfully selecting and defining system boundaries are important albeit labor-intensive tasks within the 
LCA process. LCA can be applied to product development and improvement, public policy making, 
strategic planning, and marketing, amongst other direct applications. The main parts of the LCA are –
• goal and scope definition (including functional unit and system boundaries)
27
• life cycle inventory (LCI)
• life cycle impact assessment (LCIA)
• interpretation 
As defined by the ISO standard 14040, the scope and goal of the LCA have to be clearly defined and 
consistent with the intended application. The inventory analysis involves compiling and quantifying inputs 
and outputs required throughout the product lifecycle. The impact assessment component of the LCA aims 
to understand and evaluate potential environmental impacts throughout the product lifecycle. In the 
interpretation phase, conclusions are drawn from the inventory analysis and impact assessment, and 
recommendations are made to satisfy the study's objective.
LCA of cement manufacturing has been the subject of many research efforts [57-59]. In addition, 
different localized research efforts focus on the environmental impact of cement manufacturing in different 
parts of the world, including India, Brazil, Europe, and China. [60,61]. Leading international standards on 
LCA focus mainly on the process of performing LCA. Its principles and framework are described by ISO 
14040, and ISO 14044 specifies requirements and provides guidelines [62].
Countries across the globe have also formulated a variety of standards and guidelines, such as the UK's 
PAS 2050 [63], France’s BP X30-323, and Japan’s EcoLeaf Environmental Labeling Program. However, 
the nature of a comprehensive life cycle analysis requires consideration of the inputs into the manufacturing 
process which often differ from one location to another. It also requires consideration of the context of each 
manufacturing plant's infrastructure, processes, policies, and quality control requirements. As a result, 
literature reviewed for LCA on cement manufacturing have varied in methodological approach and scope
with each author articulating the environmental impact of cement production through differing lens based 
on their goal of doing the analysis. As indicated in Table 3, LCA is used to study the environmental impact 
of different lifecycle stages of cement production and usage, such as clinker, cement, mortar, and concrete.
In addition, literature review identified other materials that can be used as additives in cement 
manufacturing or in the mix of mortar and concrete to reduce the carbon footprints of the products. These 
28
materials and the resulting estimated reduction in GHG emissions from their use include the following: 
marble waste sludges in cement – 34% [64], ornamental stone waste in cement – 9% [65], blast furnace fly 
ash and slag in concrete – 32% [66], ash from wastewater treatment plant sludges in concrete – 9% [67], 
plastic waste and carbon fibers in cement mortars – 13.69% [68], and glass powder in cement mortar – 20% 
[69].
Practitioners agree that integrating LCA into day-to-day management routines will be beneficial, 
however, the execution of LCA is challenging. The LCA process can be kept simple without compromising 
comprehensiveness and reliability by using standard procedures and assumptions, adopting techniques that 
allow comparisons between different impact categories, access to high-quality data, and using adequate 
software [70]. Integrating LCA into management routines of cement plants has become feasible with 
international standards for LCA through the ISO process, increasing the number of cement plants getting 
more digitized and adopting IoT sensors for gathering data, and improved interconnectivity and access to 
databases through application programming interfaces (API). Section 2.3 demonstrates a theoretical 
framework for the continuous assessment of the environmental impact of cement production.
3.2.1.1 Scope of the model: Functional Unit and System Boundaries
The functional unit adopted on a mass basis is the production of 1 metric ton of cement. The cradleto-gate system boundary is used for this study. Only activities that occur before arriving at and within the 
cement plant are considered since performance and impacts after the cement plant are identical across 
product systems and irrelevant for impact comparison purposes.

3.2.1.2 Life Cycle Inventory
This is the compilation of information on the inputs, outputs, waste generated, electricity, and thermal 
energy required to produce a functional unit of the product within the defined system boundary. The system 
boundary covers the following emission units listed by Lehigh Cement company in its operating permit as 
subject to Title V requirements and having applicable requirements [75]:
• Union Bridge Quarry Operations
• New Windsor Quarry Operations
• Raw Material Transport and Storage
• Raw Grinding
• Raw Meal – Kiln Feed
• Kiln and Clinker Cooler
• Coal Grinding Mill for Kiln
32
• Clinker Transport & Storage 
• Clinker Finish Mills
• Cement Storage and Shipping with Bag Packing
• Dried Biosolids Related Processes
• Emergency Generator
The data switching for the scenarios for ordinary Portland cement, Portland-limestone cement, and the 
coal and alternative fuels are implemented using Excel’s IF function on the cells of the inventory sheet 
highlighted in Figure 6 (also see the ‘INVENTORY’ sheet of the quantitative data spreadsheet). Relevant 
inventory data and impact assessment factors are sourced from data on power consumption and expert 
opinion at the Union Bridge plant of Lehigh Cement, documentation from the parent company Heidelberg 
Materials, calculation by coefficients and derivations from secondary data sources including libraries and 
databases from literature listed in notes, and amongst the sources listed in the ‘SOURCE GUIDE’ sheet of 
the quantitative datasheet in the supplementary material. Electricity from the national grid powers the 
crushing, grinding, conveying, and machine operation. Coal is used to generate the thermal energy required 
for the calcination process. This study also models production using thermal energy from the combustion 
of biosolids from treated sewage sludge from the Hampstead Waste Water Treatment Center in Carroll 
County, where the Lehigh Cement plant is situated. Dried biosolids are typically made from sewage sludge 
by maceration, pressurization, heating, decarboxylation reaction, and drying.
3.2.1.3 Life Cycle Impact Modeling
The attributional LCA approach described in [76] was adopted for this demonstration. This approach 
does not analyze the indirect consequences of the product's manufacture. It is generally restricted to using 
average impact data to allocate the environmental impacts of factors in the product's life cycle stages. The 
impact assessment factors are limited to the climate change impact category considered for this study (see 
the quantitative data spreadsheet's 'Impact Assessment' sheet). Carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and 
nitrous oxide (N2O) are the relevant gases related to the greenhouse effect. However, the relative 
33
contribution of CO2 predominates, being between 98.8% and 100%, because it is emitted at much higher 
quantities than the other gases [77]. Therefore, emissions from methane and nitrous oxide were excluded 
from this LCI.
Figure 6. Subsection of the Inventory sheet in the LCA
3.2.2 Techno-economic Assessment
The techno-economic assessment of the introduction of new technology or process is an important step 
when aiming to set a large-scale process, especially at the industrial level. To assess the economic viability 
of the change, TEA combines process modeling and engineering design with economic evaluation. TEA is 
apt for assessing decarbonization efforts from emission reduction methods in cement production. 
System dynamics are considered suitable for handling the complexities of understanding the economic 
behavior of CCU technologies. Apart from investments and operational costs, other factors such as 
government policies, market conditions, material and information delays, and the feedback process in the 
supply chain impact the economic behavior of CCU technologies [78]. In the referenced article, the authors 
simulated indirect carbonation using different hydroxides as absorbent precursors to reduce CO2 emissions 
in clinker production. They performed an analysis of the CO2 captured using a system dynamics model. 
34
They determined that CO2 capture costs 65 to 140 USD/tCO2 in the carbonation process and that a tax 
policy of 80 USD/tCO2 or more will encourage the implementation of CO2 capture.
In another assessment, the authors in [79] evaluated two Calcium Looping (CaL) processes for 
capturing CO2 in cement plants – the first integrates the CaL in the cement kiln at the tail-end such that the 
placement of the CO2 capture process is downstream in the clinker burning line and with fluidized bed 
reactors (CaO-rich sorbent). The other process integrates the CaL system with entrained flow reactors in 
which the carbonator is integrated with the preheater of the clinker burning line, treating only the flue gas 
from the rotary kiln. In their analysis, the authors determined that the tail-end and integrated CO2 capture 
processes increased the cost of cement by 67% and, 74%, respectively, while the cost of CO2 avoided was 
52 EUR/tCO2 and 58.6 EUR tCO2, respectively. Example metrics of emissions captured and the related cost 
of leveraging oxy-combustion with calcium looping vary from 94% emissions captured at $17/tCO2 [80] 
to 60% emissions captured at $40.6/tCO2 [81]. 
The following are instrumental to reducing cement prices and CO2 emissions: carbon tax, CO2 capture 
efficiency, cost-effective and energy-efficient amine blend, energy penalty, and CO2 sales price [82]. Even 
with the opportunities for CO2 capture from the process emissions from calcination, which by concession 
from literature accounts for about 60% of cement production emissions, the cement industry is cautious 
about incorporating new technology that might affect clinker composition [83]. Therefore, alternative fuels 
with lower carbon footprints and technologies leading to lower energy requirements for heat generation for 
the kiln are also assessed for their economic viability at an industrial scale. The thermal energy (about 3.2 
– 6.3 GJ per ton of clinker) required for cement production is provided by fossil fuels such as petroleum 
coke, natural gas, and coal. Alternative fuels considered in literature for cement production include tirederived fuels, commercial and industrial wastes, sewage sludge, meat and bone meal produced from 
slaughterhouse residue, agricultural biomass, and spent pot linings [84].
In a study exploring the economic feasibility of a waste recovery system that captures radiation emitted 
from the surface of a rotary kiln [85], the authors determined that for markets with electricity costing as 
much as 0.1 USD/kWh, the method could yield as much as 5% return on investment (ROI) or net present 
35
value of $0.06 million. The authors evaluated the system by combining computational fluid dynamics 
simulations with process modeling, including mass, energy, and exergy balances
3.2.2.1 Techno-economic assessment method
Process costs for the estimated annual production of 2 million tons of cement at Lehigh Cement plant 
were considered in the techno-economic assessment. It evaluates the leading economic indicators, such as 
capital and cement production costs, including raw material, energy, property, plant, and equipment. Figure 
3 is a summary table and pie chart for TEA indicators showing the distribution of overhead costs for the 
annual production of 2 million tons of ordinary Portland cement using coal for thermal energy. Equipment 
cost estimation was conservatively deduced from the acquisition cost of machines without accounting for 
freight, installation and taxes, and other capitalizable costs. Local pricing of production materials was used 
where available and national averages were adopted in other inputs. For instance, $0.1396/kWh, the average 
electricity price in Maryland [86], was adopted for electricity (see electricity cost sensitivity analysis in 
Section 3.3). In contrast, coal and dried biosolids' national average sales price was used.
Figure 7. TEA Indicator estimates for annual production in the “OPC + Coal” scenario
36
Using actual vendor quotes is recommended for TEA accuracy. However, ballpark estimates for TEA 
parameters such as energy and raw material pricing are sufficient for hotspot analysis and for generating 
order-of-magnitude estimations [87]. It should be noted that this study is focused on demonstrating the 
implementation of the continuous assessment and improvement framework; practitioners that adopt this 
framework for business decisions are encouraged to use actual vendor-provided quotes for their 
implementation.
3.2.3 Continuous assessment and improvement deployment framework
Secured deployment of IoT-enabled solutions in the cement industry is drawing the attention of 
stakeholders because of the significant value in cost reduction, the increased efficiency, and the greater 
visibility that IoT devices can provide. IoT-related technologies have been explored in the following areas 
with trials in the cement industry:
• Secured deployment [88]
• Event tracking in supervisory control and data acquisition system [89]
• Fuzzy logic-based flame image processing for rotary kiln temperature control [90]
• IoT-regulated moisture sensor [91]
• Real-time carbon dioxide monitoring based on IoT cloud technologies – MQ135 carbon dioxide 
sensor, ESP8266 Wi-Fi module, Firebase cloud storage service, and Android application [92]
Figure 8 is a simplified depiction of the use of connected devices in the production of Portland cement 
through the dry method. Sensors measure raw materials from the quarry for quality, moisture, and pH value. 
Transportation of raw materials to the plant is tracked to measure cost and related emissions. Energy 
requirements of the crushers, fuel consumption, and CO2 emission due to calcination at the kiln, moisture 
level, temperature, and coolers and grinders’ energy consumption are all measured and then transmitted to 
cloud-based servers through a gateway device.
37
Figure 8. IoT-enabled cement production
CCUS pathways that need early-stage economic and environmental performance assessment template 
development were identified in the work in [55]. The authors synthesized existing guidelines and 
approaches into actual templates that can be adopted for early-stage LCA and TEA. These templates are 
editable with a programming language with Excel handling libraries to enable database integration, 
sensitivity and uncertainty analysis, and advanced visualizations for decision-making. Python programming 
language has several open-source libraries for Excel and can be adopted for integrating LCA and TEA 
templates [93]. In addition, the required scripting, macros, and user-defined functionalities are available in 
the free version of the open-source Python library Xlwings, which also supports Numpy arrays, Pandas 
Series, and DataFrames on Windows and macOS.
Figure 9 shows the schematic diagram of a continuous assessment and improvement framework for 
analyzing the environmental and economic impact of a cement production process improvement and 
feeding back data-informed decisions for managing the plant. In this framework, data is transmitted from 
the IoT-enabled cement plant to the cloud data platform via gateway devices that connect the disparate 
networks and translate communications from one protocol to another, thus allowing bidirectional data flow 
between the cloud and the IoT devices at the cement plant.
38
Figure 9. Continuous assessment and improvement framework
The cloud services include computing infrastructure, platforms, and cloud-native applications that 
facilitate data flow from IoT sensors to storage and data processing platform. Integration with a data 
warehouse is seamless with connectors and APIs, giving the platform access to life cycle inventory 
databases and other economic and operations data required for analysis in near real-time or batch processes. 
Relevant metrics measured from the cement plant are inserted into the LCA and TEA templates with Python 
installed on the platform. Similarly, the metrics are fed into sensitivity analysis and data visualization with 
Python. Economic and environmental improvement insights drawn out of these are used for business 
decisions, reporting for compliance, and as feedback for improving the production process.
3.3 LCA – TEA Results and Discussion
3.3.1 Impacts Analysis
Assessing the impact of the significant drivers of CO2 emission for the four scenarios highlights the 
possible carbon reduction potentials of materials efficiencies from producing Portland-limestone cement to 
replace ordinary Portland cement and adopting dried biosolids as a thermal energy alternative to coal. Figure 
10 shows the impact assessment results from the "OPC + Coal" scenario, estimating the contributions of 
the major drivers to climate change when using coal for thermal heating to manufacture ordinary Portland 
cement at the plant. Based on this impact assessment, calcination leads to more than half of process 
39
emissions (about 54%), with the emissions attributable to combustion comprising most of the remaining 
emissions burden (about 40%). The emission from the other drivers, such as electricity, water, and 
transportation, contribute an estimated 6% of process emissions. 
The production of a ton of ordinary Portland cement with thermal energy from coal is estimated to 
result in a global warming potential (GWP) of 856 kg CO2-eq. 100-year time horizon GWP, as provided by 
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change [94], gives a standard unit of measure of how much energy 
the emissions of a ton of a gas will absorb over some time relative to the emissions of a ton of carbon 
dioxide, the gas used as a reference.
The estimate of climate change contribution by drivers varies under different scenarios, such as the 
production of Portland-limestone cement and the use of dried biosolids. Table 4 summarizes the climate 
change driver contributions in these scenarios. The results indicate the potential of reducing greenhouse gas 
emissions from 856 kg CO2-eq per ton of ordinary Portland cement using coal for heating, to 788 kg CO2-
eq per ton of Portland-limestone cement using dried biosolids for heating. This is an opportunity for a 7.9% 
reduction in CO2 emission from material efficiency.

Portland-limestone blended cement, which has additional limestone used as an ingredient amounting 
to about 15% of the mass, has reduced calcination and fuel combustion CO2 emissions when compared to 
ordinary Portland cement. The assessment indicates that the production of the blended cement has a 6.4% 
lower carbon footprint than the production of the ordinary Portland cement at the Lehigh Cement plant at 
Union Bridge, reducing emissions from 856 kg CO2-eq/t to 801 kg CO2-eq/t. Going by annual production 
of 2 million tons of cement, the switch to the Portland-limestone cement positions the plant to avoid 
approximately 123,000 tons of carbon dioxide emissions annually. This could be a cost more than $3million 
if there were a tax of $25/ton. In 2022 carbon tax rates in the United Kingdom was $24/ton and as high as 
$137/ton in Uruguay [95]. Using renewable energy sources for electricity to power the crushers and grinders 
would further reduce the climate change arising from process electricity use. However, we need to be 
circumspect when interpreting data for impact categories because emerging LCA impact categories and 
inventory items are still under development, can vary depending on the source of data and specific situations 
in the analysis, and can have high levels of uncertainty that preclude acceptance pending further 
development.
Using a continuous emission monitoring system (CEMS) is vital for emission data input in 
implementing the continuous assessment and improvement framework. CEMS is the equipment required 
to determine the gas concentration or emission rate. It is required for some United States Environmental 
Protection Agency regulations for continual compliance or to determine if emission standards are exceeded. 
41
CEMS use pollutant analyzer measurements and a conversion equation, graph, or computer program to 
produce results in units of the applicable emission limitation or standard [96].
3.3.2. Economic Analysis
The economic analysis is premised on the annual production of 2 million tons of cement at Lehigh 
Cement’s Union Bridge plant. Based on the indicator summary, the estimated optimal cost of producing a 
ton of ordinary Portland cement using coal is $58.69. However, producing similarly performant Portlandlimestone cement using dried biosolids can reduce this cost by 10.87% to $52.31/ton (see the ‘Indicators’ 
and ‘Inventory’ sheets of the quantitative data spreadsheet in supplementary material).
The sensitivity analysis of the production volume of cement at the plant indicates that given the 
estimated data points, the cost-optimal production volume is 2.4 million tons at the cost of $58.6/ton. Figure 
11 plots the manufacturing cost sensitivity of ordinary Portland cement to the production volume at the 
plant. The inflection point on the cost is at an annual production volume of 800,000 tons.
Figure 11. Cost sensitivity to production volumes
In addition, sensitivity analysis of the cost of electricity indicates that production cost increases by 12% 
to $65.77 when cost of electricity goes up from $0.15/kWh to $0.33/kWh. September 2021 average costs 
of electricity in US states ranged from $0.10 in Arkansas to $0.33 in Hawaii [97]. Figure 12 is a plot of 
manufacturing cost sensitivity to the cost of electricity. Distance from the quarry to the plant can also impact

the cost of production due to the increase in transportation costs. However, the cost in this analysis is 
premised on the proximity of the New Windsor quarry to the cement plant. The crushed material from the 
quarry is transported to the cement plant via 4.5 miles-long overland conveyor.
The uncertainty analysis indicates that the number of personnel available on work shifts did not 
significantly affect the cost of production because plant personnel cost is only 0.2% of the cost of 
production. However, fluctuations in the cost of other raw materials can impact the cost of production

Figure 13 plots the cost sensitivities to production volumes for the four production scenarios highlighted 
in Table 4. It visually compares the cost sensitivity to production volume using the different production 
inputs in the four scenarios. The visualization was created using the subplot() function in Matplotlib that 
enables drawing multiple graphs in a single plot. Matplotlib is a comprehensive Python library for creating 
static, animated, and interactive visualizations [98].
The plots have a similar shape with declining cost/ton as production volume increases until the point 
of inflection when cost/ton remains stable despite further production increases. Notice, however, that 
production cost is lower in the scenarios where thermal heat is provided from the combustion of dried 
biosolids. The model uses fair market pricing for dried biosolids made from drying sewage sludge with a 
heating value of approximately 7,000 Btu/lb. The economic analysis can be expanded to include the capital 
43
investment required to dry the sewage sludge if it is within the boundary of the analysis for a production 
plant that produces its alternative fuel as part of the circular economic process.

3.3.3. The Deployment Framework
This study contributes to developing practical approaches to integrating sustainability into cement 
production. It addresses integrating economic and environmental impact assessments into cement 
production operations. The framework can facilitate the dynamic implementation of sustainability 
innovations and the continuous measurement of their performance. Beyond mere rhetoric, cement 
manufacturers that have made a public commitment to fighting climate change can leverage this 
deployment framework in whole, or parts, to be on their way to meeting their emission reduction targets. 
This is demonstrated using production scenarios at a US cement plant.
The continuous assessment and improvement deployment framework enables dynamic management of 
production inputs to optimize the cost of production and reduce carbon emissions. The problem is expressed 
44
as a minimization of production cost by defining it as a linear function subject to linear constraints. The 
constraints considered include the demand for cement types, the cost, and availability of raw materials such 
as alternative fuels, emission compliance requirements, and the company's commitment to lower emissions. 
The computation is executed as a linear programming problem to find the feasible region and optimal 
solution. Data to define the linear constraints based on cost, availability, operational policies, and 
compliance are pulled from readings at the plant and supplied interactively by process managers. Complex 
computations and graphical representations of the information are enabled by leveraging appropriate 
libraries and APIs in the cloud platform. Insights thus generated aid decision-making and position the 
cement plant as a dynamic, innovative, and responsible business committed to its operations' sustainability 
and open to rapid testing and experimentation.
The framework has opportunities for further optimization. It can also be coupled with other business 
operation and reporting systems to source actual operations and financial metrics as input data and directly 
supply needed information to the other systems. Business uncertainties such as raw material price volatility 
can be quantified using Python libraries for Monte Carlo simulation.
