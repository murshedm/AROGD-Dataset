Chapter 5 – Electrical Energy Efficiency and Decarbonization in Cement Raw Meal Grinding
Chapter 1 of this dissertation highlighted the gap in research efforts to optimize EEC in cement 
production compared to efforts to optimize thermal energy despite the significant decarbonization 
opportunities in EEC optimization. The submission was that EEC in raw meal grinding is a critical aspect 
of cement production, where grinding operations can account for up to 27% of total plant electricity 
demand. The literature review in Chapter 2 covered the theoretical foundation of optimization methods, 
including the application of AI. This section of the dissertation shares the experimental applications of 
advanced industrial analytics to optimize EEC in cement raw meal grinding, highlights the findings, and 
discusses the results and their implications for decarbonization in the cement industry and other electrical 
energy-intensive manufacturing processes.
5.1 Raw Meal Grinding Process
Cement raw materials include limestone, clay, marl, sand, gypsum, silica, alumina, and iron. The raw 
meal grinding process is a series of steps and components that transform the raw materials into a fine meal 
that meets the specifications for cement production. The method includes a feeding mechanism for 
introducing the raw materials into the grinding system, batch binning to ensure uniformity in particle size, 
stirring and mixing, crushing and grinding, and grading that separates the ground materials based on 
fineness. The process is a critical step that determines both the final product's quality and the production 
process's overall energy efficiency. It involves the grinding of raw materials to a specific fineness that is 
essential for effective clinker calcination. The grinding system has specific technical requirements and 
quality control parameters [134]. Raw meal fineness must be carefully controlled to ensure optimal clinker 
formation and is typically specified as residue percentage on an 80 m sieve. Industry standards usually 
require 12-15% residue for efficient calcination [135].
5.1.1 Key Considerations in the Raw Meal Grinding Process
The key factors of raw meal grinding quality requirements include composition uniformity, chemical 
parameter monitoring, and the efficiency of the grinding equipment. Variability in the composition of the 
70
raw meal may adversely affect clinker reactivity. As part of chemical control, the lime saturation factor, 
silica modulus, alumina modulus, and the levels of SO3 must be monitored. The grinding media and 
equipment design also go a long way in determining raw meal efficiency and quality outcomes. There is 
often a trade-off between stringent quality control measures and their cost implications. Striking the right 
balance between these two remains challenging in the cement industry.
Energy consumption patterns in raw meal grinding, which could account for up to 27% of total 
electricity consumption, represent a critical factor in cement production efficiency and sustainability, 
making it a prime target for optimization efforts [136,137]. According to Meng et al., 2021, the mean energy 
consumption of raw material preparation in China's cement industry has significantly decreased from 30.88 
kWh/t in 2014 to 16.13 kWh/t in 2019. The average specific electrical energy consumption baseline from 
the data collected from the cement plant for this research was 15.55 kWh/t. Advancements have been made 
in reducing EEC in raw meal grinding through equipment technology improvements and a better 
understanding of material properties. However, the industry still faces challenges in standardizing these 
improvements across diverse conditions of operations and scales of production.
5.1.2 The Complexity of Cement Raw Meal Grinding Optimization
The challenges with optimizing EEC in the raw meal grinding revolves around the complexity of the 
process and the requirements for accuracy in modeling. The nonlinear nature of grinding and the 
variabilities in the conditions at the plant, complicates the establishment of effective mathematical models 
for optimization. Raw material heterogeneity such as limestone compositional variability, moisture content 
fluctuations, and hardness variations, contribute to the complexity that render traditional optimization 
approaches inadequate. The variabilities in the conditions at the cement plant include the following:
• Equipment degradation patterns affecting performance.
• Environmental factors such as temperature and humidity influencing process efficiency.
• Human operator interventions and decision-making patterns.
• Process interdependencies across multiple subsystems. 
71
5.2 EEC Optimization Research Objectives
With the cement industry at the critical intersection of global industrial energy consumption and 
environmental impact, optimizing EEC in the raw meal grinding process presents a significant opportunity 
for improvement. Traditional optimization approaches have not resulted in sustainability practices at the 
cement plant because they have struggled to fully address the grinding process's inherent complexity and 
nonlinearity, and their outcomes have been difficult to translate to actual interventions at the cement plant.
Advances in IoT and AI/ML methods offer promising pathways for optimizing industrial processes through 
their ability to read and adapt to changing operational conditions and handle complex multivariate systems. 
Applying these technologies to raw meal grinding could be a transformative approach to reducing electrical 
energy consumption and associated carbon emissions while maintaining product quality and ensuring 
economic viability.
This study investigates the optimization of EEC in cement raw meal grinding through the application 
of Causal Bayesian Optimization. Leveraging the probabilistic framework of Bayesian statistics and 
incorporating causal relationships between process variables enables efficient exploration of the parameter 
space while accounting for the interdependencies between operational variables, material properties, and 
energy consumption patterns. The proposed approach integrates process data, quality parameters, and 
energy consumption metrics to create an optimization strategy that balances environmental and economic 
objectives. Moreover, the research findings easily translate to actual energy consumption reduction 
interventions at the cement plant.
5.3 EEC Optimization Research Methods 
The research focuses specifically on the raw meal grinding process, one of the most energy-intensive 
processes in cement production and a well-bounded system for study. The research findings could apply to 
other electrical energy-intensive industrial operations, especially those involving grinding. The study was 
undertaken to answer the following research questions:
72
1. How can causal relationships between operational variables be systematically identified and leveraged 
in cement raw meal grinding optimization, where traditional ML approaches fail due to confounding 
variables and complex interdependencies?
2. What framework can effectively handle the significant real-world disturbances (material variations, 
environmental factors, equipment degradation) that render conventional optimization approaches 
inadequate in industrial cement manufacturing?
3. How can Causal Bayesian Optimization be adapted to complex, real-world industrial systems with 
operational constraints, quality requirements, and safety considerations?
4. What is the relative importance of key operational variables in determining grinding energy efficiency?
This study covers the following system development steps:
• Development of an understanding of the raw meal grinding process to be modeled.
• Identification of the critical components of the raw meal grinding system and the data points 
required. 
• Installation of data collection field assets throughout the raw meal grinding system.
• Data collection, cleaning, and preprocessing of inputs and operational variables for the cement 
plant's raw meal grinding operations from 2020 to 2024.
• Exploratory data analysis and feature importance analysis to determine control, manipulatable, and 
disturbance variables and determine which ones are predictive of the EEC.
• Algorithm selection and customization.
• Model training, testing, and validation.
• Model output evaluation and industry consultations on practicability and cost implications of 
implementing the manufacturing system conditions that will enable the optimal EEC output 
generated.
This study aims to understand better causes or actions that can lead to a reduction in EEC and identify 
practical interventions for optimizing EEC during the raw meal grinding process.

The objective function is defined as:
Minimize: 𝑓(𝑥) = 𝑆𝐸𝐸𝐶(𝑥) + 𝜆1.𝑄𝑢𝑎𝑙𝑖𝑡𝑦𝑃𝑒𝑛𝑎𝑙𝑡𝑦(𝑥) + 𝜆2 . 𝑆𝑡𝑎𝑏𝑖𝑙𝑖𝑡𝑦𝑃𝑒𝑛𝑎𝑙𝑡𝑦(𝑥) (8)
Subject to:
• Quality constraints, raw material volume mixture
• Equipment operational limits for each control variable
• Process stability constraints to prevent rapid parameter fluctuations
Where 𝑥 represents the vector of controllable process parameters.
𝑆𝐸𝐸𝐶(𝑥) is the Specific Electrical Energy Consumption (kWh/ton).
𝑄𝑢𝑎𝑙𝑖𝑡𝑦𝑃𝑒𝑛𝑎𝑙𝑡𝑦(𝑥) enforces constraints on product quality metrics such as raw material combination 
requirements and fineness residue.
𝑆𝑡𝑎𝑏𝑖𝑙𝑖𝑡𝑦𝑃𝑒𝑛𝑎𝑙𝑡𝑦(𝑥) penalizes solutions that may cause operational instability.
The weighting coefficients 𝜆1 and 𝜆2 are numerical values determining the relative importance of 
different terms in the multi-objective optimization problem. They enable the adjustment of priorities, 
balancing of competing objectives, normalization (since terms have different scales), and parameter tuning.
The review of the Iterative Causal Optimization and the Causal Bayesian Optimization methods in Chapter 
2 revealed opportunities to address the following challenges with implementing these methods in practice 
in the industry: causal discovery uncertainties, computational complexity, computational demands, and 
challenges with scaling to high-dimensional spaces. The hybrid causal optimization method proposed in 
this study attempts to solve these challenges.
5.4 Hybrid Causal Optimization
This study's memory-efficient hybrid causal optimization represents an approach for addressing largescale optimization problems in high-energy-dependent manufacturing processes. This implementation 
leverages the unique strengths of both iterative causal inference and CBO and manages the computational 
demands of complex industrial systems. The features and key improvements on the CBO are highlighted 
below:
74
1) Causal structure identification: 
i. The hybrid causal optimization uses Random Forest-based cross-validation from the iterative 
approach for robust causal effect estimation. 𝜏̂𝑗
, the estimated causal effect of variable 𝑋𝑗 on 
outcome 𝑌 is given by:
𝜏̂𝑗 = 
1
𝐾
∑
∑ (𝑌𝑖 −̂𝑌𝑖
(−𝑘)
).(𝑋𝑖𝑗 − 𝑋̂
𝑖𝑗
(−𝑘)
) 𝑖∈𝑇𝑘
∑ (𝑋𝑖𝑗 − ̂𝑋𝑖𝑗
(−𝑘)
𝑖∈𝜏𝑘
)
2
𝐾
𝑘=1
(9)
Where 𝐾 is the number of cross-validation folds
𝑇𝑘 is the test set for fold 𝑘, 𝑌𝑖
is the actual outcome for observation 𝑖
̂𝑌𝑖
(−𝑘)
is the predicted outcome using a model trained on all folds except 𝑘
𝑋𝑖𝑗 is the value of variable 𝑋𝑗
for observation 𝑖
𝑋̂
𝑖𝑗
(−𝑘)
is the predicted value of 𝑋𝑖𝑗 using a model trained on all folds except 𝑘
ii. It incorporates memory-efficient batching from the Bayesian approach.
iii. It maintains a causal graph structure with weighted edges.
2) Optimization Strategy:
i. The hybrid causal optimization combines Gaussian Process-based Bayesian optimization with 
iterative causal updates.
ii. It uses a custom kernel that incorporates causal structure information. The causal-weighted 
kernel with adaptive length scales is given by:
𝑘𝑐𝑎𝑢𝑠𝑎𝑙(𝑥, 𝑥
′
) = 𝜎𝑓
2
exp (−
1
2
∑
(𝑥𝑗− 𝑥𝑗
′
)
2
(𝑙𝑗
.𝑤𝑗
)
2
)
𝑑
𝑗=1
(10)
Where 𝑤𝑗 = 
1
1+|𝜏̂𝑗
|
is a weight that modifies the length scales based on causal effects.
iii. It modifies the expected improvement of the acquisition function 𝐸𝐼(𝑥) to account for causal 
influences. The causal-weighted expected improvement is
𝐸𝐼𝑐𝑎𝑢𝑠𝑎𝑙(𝑥) = 𝐸𝐼(𝑥) . (1 + 𝛽 ∑ |𝜏̂𝑗
|
𝑑
𝑗=1
. |𝑥𝑗
|) (11)
Where 𝛽 is the exploration weight parameter that controls the influence of causal effects.
75
iv. Whereas CBO minimizes the acquisition function 𝑥𝑡+1= arg 𝑚𝑖𝑛𝑥∈𝑋
𝐸𝐼(𝑥), the hybrid approach 
adds a causal gradient step. 
𝑥𝑡
′ = 𝑥𝑡 − 𝜂 . 𝑠𝑖𝑔𝑛(𝜏̂) ⨀ |𝜏̂| (12)
𝑥𝑡+1= arg 𝑚𝑖𝑛𝑥∈𝑋
𝐸𝐼𝑐𝑎𝑢𝑠𝑎𝑙(𝑥)
where 𝑥𝑡
′
is an intermediate point after applying the causal gradient, 𝜂 is the step size, 𝑠𝑖𝑔𝑛(𝜏̂)
determines direction, ⨀ is element-wise multiplication of the matrices and |𝜏̂| weights the step size by 
causal strength.
3) Memory Efficiency:
i. The implementation uses batch processing for large datasets.
ii. It includes garbage collection at critical points.
iii. It allows toggling between memory-efficient and full-data modes.
The implementation of the hybrid causal optimization has a more robust causal effect estimation using 
Random Forest cross-validation. It incorporates causal knowledge into the GP kernel and acquisition 
function, enabling adaptive exploration based on causal structure. It also handles operational constraints 
better with causal considerations. However, the implementation is more complex and requires the proper 
definition of operational constraints and more detailed process knowledge for optimal configuration.
5.5 Experimental Implementation and Results
5.5.1 Data Collection
This research utilized hourly operational data collected from the cement manufacturing plant from 
January 2020 to December 2024. The dataset encompasses over 30,300 hours of operation from the cement 
plant's raw meal grinding subsystem. The time series data collected includes process parameters, energy 
consumption metrics, and quality indicators. Table 9 is a logical grouping of features collected for the 
experiment.
Mill operational data and material moisture content were measured at one-hour intervals through 
sensors, meters, and the plant's distributed control system. Specific electrical energy consumption was 
76
computed from total raw mill feed and raw mill energy consumption. This measurement, which is in kWh/t, 
enables standardization because the target variable is the electrical energy required for processing a ton of 
raw mill feed.
The experiment’s computing environment is set up using Python programming language on the Apple 
M1 chip, which has an 8-core CPU with four performance cores and four efficiency cores, an 8-core GPU, 
and a 16-core Neural Engine.
5.5.2 Data Preprocessing
Data preprocessing involved inspection and rationalization of the data against the measurement units 
and subject matter expert’s expected range of values of the variables from the raw mill grinding subsystem. 
Outlier detection was applied with values exceeding the threshold of three standard deviations from the 
mean flagged for verification. Missing values (approximately 2.6% of the dataset) were addressed using 
forward-fill for short gaps and linear interpolation for longer interruptions, thus maintaining data integrity.
One set of duplicated data captured under different variable names was removed. Specifically, the power 
of the bucket elevator of the raw meal subsystem, the power of the classifier motor, and the fan air duct 
temperature were each duplicated, with each variable having two different names.

Notice that the multicollinearity between these variables captured in Table 10 indicates that the highlighted 
variables have maximum correlations of 1 with other columns on the dataset. The assumption that predictor 
variables are independent is not valid for this dataset as predictor variables are also correlated.
5.5.3 Exploratory Data Analysis
Initial exploratory data analysis was done to understand the data and generate insights. The 
correlation heatmap of the variables was generated to identify patterns and correlations. The 
predictive power score heatmap of the independent variables and target variable was also generated 
to detect the variables that were more predictive of specific electrical energy consumption. (See 
items II and III in the Appendix). As expected, many predictor variables had negative correlations 
with SEEC, with the raw material flow variables having the highest negative correlations. 
Correlations are generated with Pearson correlation, and the predictive power scoring uses a 
decision tree regressor.
5.5.4 Causal Discovery
Causal discovery reveals which adjustments will genuinely reduce electrical energy consumption in 
cement grinding rather than just identifying variables that happen to change together. In the initial causal 
network discovery and estimation, causality was explored in a 5-variable subset of the dataset built with 
the target and predictor variables with the highest predictive power scores. Figure 17 is a time-series plot 
of these predictor variables and the target variable. A visual inspection reveals the peaks in the target 
variable VT corresponding to the peaks in the predictor variables (V1, V2, V3, V4). 
Tigramite, a Python package for the PC algorithm combined with momentary conditional independence 
(PCMCI), was adopted for estimating causal networks from this large-scale time series dataset [138]. The
PC (Peter-Clark) algorithm is a well-known method for learning the structure of Bayesian networks through 
conditional independence tests. However, it can be computationally intensive, especially for large datasets.

Effective builds of the algorithm that take advantage of GPU-based parallel processing ease its adoption 
for high dimensional causal discovery [139, 140]. Assuming cause and effect are linearly dependent, 
PCMCI was initialized on the data subset using the independence test, the partial correlation test that 
considers the null distribution to be Student's t.
Figure 17: Timeseries plot of top five predictor variables against target variable
Figure 18 is a plot of the lag function matrix showing time-lagged correlations (up to 10 time steps) 
between the variables in the system. This plot helps identify which variables influence others and at what 
time delay, revealing temporal causal relationships in the cement raw meal grinding system. The causal 
graph structure of the dataset shows which variables influence others and at what time lag, along with their 
statistical significance and effect strengths. This causal model forms the foundation for optimization by 
identifying which process variables drive changes in electrical energy consumption.
Figure 19 plots the time series graph showing the causal system discovered with respect to its time 
dependency. This plot is a causal graph visualization from the PCMCI analysis results that show variables 
as nodes and causal relationships as arrows between them. (See the output of the PCMCI algorithm in item 
81
IV in the Appendix). Arrow colors indicate the strength of causal effects, and the direction shows which 
variable influences which and helps to identify the key drivers of electrical energy consumption in the raw 
meal grinding system. Figure 20, on the other hand, shows a standard network diagram where the spatial 
arrangement of nodes does not represent time. Instead, it focuses on the overall causal structure - depicting 
which variables influence others (shown by directed arrows) and the strength of those relationships (shown 
by color intensity)

Having established the causal structure underlying the raw meal grinding process, below is a 
generalizable system architecture for electrical energy consumption optimization. This framework provides 
the foundation upon which the three optimization methods explored operate.
As shown in Figure 21, the architecture consists of four primary components: 
1. a data acquisition layer that collects real-time measurements from process sensors and energy 
monitoring systems
2. a causal model layer that maintains and updates the discovered causal relationships
3. an optimization engine implementing one of the three methods explored in this study
4. a control integration layer that translates optimization recommendations into actionable parameter 
adjustments.
This modular design allows flexible implementation across various grinding system configurations 
while maintaining consistent optimization capabilities.
83
Figure 21: Process diagram of the optimization framework
Critical to this architecture is the bidirectional information flow between the causal model and 
optimization components, which enables continuous refinement as operational conditions evolve. This 
framework can be enabled with a machine learning system that keeps data flow direction conventions 
between components, as illustrated in Figure 22.
Building upon this architecture, we now examine the results from the three optimization approaches: 
iterative causal inference, which leverages sequential interventions based on causal strength; causal 
Bayesian optimization, which incorporates uncertainty quantification to balance exploration and 
exploitation; and hybrid causal optimization, which combines the strengths of both previous methods to 
address the complex dynamics of industrial grinding systems.
84

5.5.5 Feature importance
Two approaches were used to determine feature importance. First, absolute feature importance was 
performed using the chi-squared statistical test to identify the 21 most relevant features for the optimization 
model. This enables the identification of the variables with the strongest statistical relationship with the 
target variable—SEEC—allowing the optimization to focus on the most influential parameters in the 
cement raw meal grinding process. Table 11 lists the top 21 features and their feature importance score. 
The scores indicate how strongly each input variable is associated with the target variable. A higher 
score suggests a stronger relationship between the feature and SEEC in the cement raw meal grinding 
process. While these scores help identify relevant features, they do not indicate the relationship's direction 
or capture nonlinear relationships that might exist in the grinding process.

The second feature selection method uses the Extra Trees Classifier algorithm to implement a treebased relative feature importance analysis [141]. The algorithm implements an estimator that fits 
randomized decision trees on sub-samples of the dataset and uses averaging to improve the predictive 
accuracy and control over-fitting. Its feature importance property is an impurity-based feature importance 
known as Gini importance. The approach determines feature importance by measuring how much each 
feature contributes to decreasing impurity across all trees in the ensemble. Features used more frequently 
for splits and greater information gain receive higher importance scores. It captures nonlinear relationships 
that statistical tests might have missed. Figure 22 is a view of the variables that most strongly influence 
SEEC. Many variables are also featured in the feature importance selection from the statistical tests. 
86
However, some features were unique in the selection using either method, and there was also differentiation 
of the ranking of the features common to both selection methods. See the Appendix for the correlation 
heatmap visualization of all the variables (Figure 23) and the top variables from feature importance (Figure 
24). The heatmaps help visualize the variables strongly related to each other, which is valuable for 
understanding interdependence and potential redundancies in the optimization model.
Figure 23: Feature importance using the Extra Trees Classifier algorithm
5.5.6 Iterative causal inference
Iterative causal inference combines causal discovery and iterative optimization to systematically 
identify and adjust the most influential variables for reducing electrical energy consumption. Our 
implementation of it for optimizing SEEC includes the following:
• An optimizer initialization function with the following parameters creates an empty directed graph 
to store the causal structure: 5 cross-validation splits, significance threshold for causal 
relationships, and maximum optimization iterations.
• A causal structure identification function to discover causal relationships between input variables 
and the target variable.
87
• A causal effect estimation function that implements a double machine learning approach to 
estimate causal effects. This function uses cross-validation to avoid overfitting and trains Random 
Forest models [142] to predict both the potential cause and the outcome.
• An optimize function that performs iterative optimization based on discovered causal structure and 
returns optimized parameters and the full optimization trajectory. These are the steps for each 
iteration:
o Updates variables proportionally to their causal effect (negative direction to minimize 
SEEC)
o applies constraints – constraints were defined with scale requirements between variables, 
and successively with minimum and maximum of variables in observational data, and 
then within top and bottom deciles of a subset of observational variables as guided by 
subject matter experts (see results from using different constraint definitions in Table 12)
o re-evaluates causal structure after updates
o tracks optimization path
For the first initialization, a significance threshold for causal relationships of 0.05 and maximum 
optimization iterations of 10 were applied. The constraints for the variables were built from the minimum 
and maximum of observational data. These parameters generated an optimized prediction of 15.47 kWh/t 
SEEC. This is a marginal improvement of 0.51% on the 15.55kWh/t average SEEC observed from the data 
collected at the cement plant.
After parameter tweaks, the best result obtained using iterative causal inference was an optimized 
prediction of 14.83 kWh/t SEEC, which is a 4.6% improvement. The parameters that gave the best result 
were a significance threshold for causal relationships of 0.1 and maximum optimization iterations of 20, 
using constraints built from the top and bottom deciles of observational data.
88
5.5.7 Causal Bayesian Optimization
The efficient implementation of the constrained CBO combines causal discovery with Bayesian 
optimization. It uses various efficiency techniques (batching, sampling, vectorization) to handle larger 
datasets and includes the following functions:
• An initialization function with the following parameters: number of optimization iterations, size of 
data batches for processing, an exploration weight variable that controls exploration versus 
exploitation balance, and a standard scaler for normalizing data.
• A function that estimates the causal effect of a single treatment variable on the target using simple 
linear regression after removing the impact of other variables and a fast approximation approach 
for computational efficiency. 
• A function that discovers causal relationships between input variables and the target and processes 
data in batches to reduce memory usage. For each variable, the function calculates causal effects 
across multiple batches and returns a dictionary of variables and their average causal effects.
• A function that creates a causal kernel by doing the following:
o Creates a specialized Gaussian Process kernel weighted by causal effects
o Sets kernel length scales inversely proportional to causal effect strength
o The variables with stronger causal effects get smaller length scales (have more influence)
o Returns a composite kernel (constant kernel x radial basis functions RBF) for the Gaussian 
Process [143, 144]
• An expected improvement (EI) function calculates the expected improvement acquisition function 
using a vectorized implementation for computational efficiency and returns an array of EI values 
for candidate points.
• An optimization process function for the following:
o Main optimization loop using Bayesian optimization principles.
o Scales input and output data for numerical stability.
89
o Identifies causal structure to inform the optimization process.
o Creates and trains a Gaussian Process model on a subset of data.
o Generates candidate points, applies constraints, and selects the most promising using 
expected improvements.
o Tracks optimization path and returns the best solution found.
Execution of this CBO implementation used constraints built from the top and bottom deciles of 
observational data and default parameters (50 iterations, batch size of 500, and exploration weight of 0.1), 
producing an optimized prediction of 14.92 kWh/t SEEC. However, this reduction in SEEC is not as good 
as the best prediction of 14.83 kWh/t SEEC from the iterative causal inference method.
5.5.8 Hybrid Causal Optimization
This hybrid approach is a more advanced implementation that combines the strengths of iterative causal 
optimization and CBO while managing computational resources more carefully. Like the CBO 
implementation, the hybrid approach also has functions that estimate the causal effect, identify causal 
structure, create the causal kernel, utilize expected improvement, and optimize. Highlighted below are the 
major differences between the hybrid and CBO implementations:
• Integration—The hybrid optimizer combines the Random Forest and Gaussian Process approaches, 
while the CBO uses only simplified linear regression for causal discovery and Random Forest for 
rigorous causal effect estimation.
• Causal structure: The hybrid implementation maintains an explicit causal graph of significant 
relationships using NetworkX [145] and handles memory constraints with optional sampling. The 
CBO implementation only maintains a dictionary of effects without graph representation.
• Kernel design: The hybrid uses a more sophisticated kernel combining RBF and Matern 
components [146] with causal weighting, while the CBO uses only an RBF kernel.
• Optimization process: The hybrid uses formal minimization of the acquisition function, while the 
CBO implementation uses simpler candidate sampling and selection. The hybrid implements 
90
garbage collection to manage memory during optimization, and the process has sophisticated 
constraints handling.
A comparison of the hybrid causal optimization method's performance to the baseline of average SEEC 
from observational data establishes the advantage the hybrid approach offers. The hybrid causal 
optimization implementation produced an optimized prediction of 11.397 kWh/t SEEC. This is a potential 
improvement of 26.7% on the 15.55kWh/t average SEEC observed from the data collected at the cement 
plant.
Table 12 summarizes the optimized prediction of SEEC using each of the three methods and different 
constraint definitions. The computation was done with SEEC as the target variable, so this implies that the 
result of the hybrid causal optimization indicates the potential of reducing the electrical energy used to grind 
a ton of raw meal at the cement plant by 26.7%, and this should scale to the production quantity of the 
cement plant assuming that all the variables from all the components of the system can be kept at the levels 
that resulted in the optimized SEEC throughout production.

11.397kWh/t SEEC using the hybrid causal optimization method. The hard constraints within the 
optimization algorithm assure the quality of production at the model's recommendation of optimal SEEC, 
preventing it from suggesting parameter settings that could violate quality specifications.

5.6 Discussion
5.6.1 Expert system introduction
An expert system for automatically maintaining optimal grinding parameters using the hybrid causal 
optimization solution would operate as a closed loop causal optimization control system. This is an 
advanced process control (APC) system that does the following:
• Continuously monitors all input variables (raw material properties, equipment metrics, process 
control metrics).
• Applies the hybrid causal optimizer’s model to determine optimal operating parameters.
• Automatically adjust control variables (feed rates, separator speeds, fan operations).
• Incorporates feedback loops to validate energy consumption and quality outcomes.
• Features self-learning capabilities to refine the causal model over time.
A comprehensive quality assurance framework will be preferred when using the hybrid causal optimizer 
in an advanced process control system. Such a framework would include some of the following:
• Real-time quality constraint integration would implement hard constraints within the algorithm to 
prevent the suggestion of parameter settings that could violate quality specifications.
• A multi-objective evaluation that incorporates quality as a secondary optimization objective instead 
of treating it as just a constraint would leverage a composite score that weighs both energy reduction 
and quality metrics to track an optimal solution that represents different trade-offs.
• Post-implementation validation executed with increased sampling frequency for quality testing and 
a comparison of actual quality metrics against predicted values
• An expert review system uses a semi-automated workflow where model recommendations receive 
human expert review before implementation. In such an arrangement, quality engineers set 
additional constraints based on current conditions, and the system learns from rejected 
recommendations to improve future suggestions.
94
5.6.2 Sustainability Impact 
For a cement plant that produced about 3.13 million metric tons of cement in 2024, a 26.7% reduction 
in the electrical energy used for grinding raw meal is an estimated reduction in emission of 10.5 million 
pounds of CO2 from electricity generation [147]. To put this in context, 10.5 million pounds of CO2
reduction is equivalent to carbon sequestration from planting approximately 22,000 trees and letting them 
grow for 10 years [148] or the removal of approximately 1,000 passenger vehicles from the road for an 
entire year [149]. Implementing this energy saving measure would have resultant ecosystem benefits, show 
industry leadership, regulatory compliance, and other ripple effects. Ecosystem benefits include a decrease 
in acid rain potential from reduced sulfur and nitrogen oxide emissions associated with electricity 
generation and reduced particulate matter emissions that affect local air quality.
This reduction in electrical energy consumption demonstrates the feasibility of significantly reducing 
emissions without compromising production capacity. It would also represent pioneering efficiency in an 
industry that accounts for approximately 8% of global CO2 emissions and establish a new industry 
benchmark for energy efficiency in the grinding process. It potentially puts the plant ahead of increasingly 
stringent carbon regulations and reduces vulnerability to future carbon pricing mechanisms.
Implementation at this scale also suggests that if adopted industry-wide, similar optimization could reduce 
global emissions by millions of tons annually. It also creates a model for other energy-intensive industrial 
processes and advances the technical knowledge base for industrial decarbonization.
5.6.3 Economic Benefits
For a cement plant with an annual production of 3.13 million tons, a 26.7% reduction in electrical 
energy for raw meal grinding translates to substantial operating cost savings. Below is an estimated 
economic benefit analysis:
• Raw meal grinding at the plant consumes 15.55 kWh/t, which accounts for 25% of the total plant 
electrical consumption. 
• Estimated total grinding energy: 3.13M tons x 15.55kWh/t = 48.67M kWh annually
95
• Estimated energy saved: 48.67M kWh x 26.7% = 13M kWh annually
• At industrial electricity rates of $0.13/kWh in Maryland, this represents annual savings of $1.69 
million.
Estimating implementation costs to be between $500,000 - $1,000,000 broken down as follows:
• Software development and integration: $150,000-$300,000
• Additional sensors and control equipment: $200,000-$400,000
• System commissioning and optimization: $100,000-$200,000
• Staff training: $50,000 - $100,000
The return on investment can be estimated as:
• Simple payback period: 3.5 - 7.1 months
• First-year ROI (return on investment): 169%-338%
• 5-year NPV (net present value) at 7% discount rate: $6.3 million
• Internal rate of return (IRR): 165%-190%
Long-term financial impacts will include direct energy savings, reduced maintenance costs, extended 
equipment life from reduced mechanical stress, and potential carbon credit revenue. This indicates that the 
economic benefits are substantial, with a very attractive estimated return on investment and a rapid payback 
period.
5.6.4 Industry benchmarks
Table 14 captures the optimal parameters readout of power metrics from the hybrid causal optimization 
at kW/ton. This enables a comparison of the metrics with industry standards at the same scale. Table 15
summarizes industry benchmarking data on energy consumption (not including equipment-level specifics) 
extracted from cement manufacturing and sustainability documents from researchers, the International 
Energy Agency, Global Cement and Concrete Association, US Environmental Protection Agency, and 
European Cement Research Academy [150-154]. The predicted SEEC of 11.397kWh/t from the hybrid 
causal optimization puts the solution in best practice rating for raw material grinding.

5.6.5 Challenges with implementation
While various advanced process control systems exist for cement grinding, as far as the author knows, 
there isn't currently a commercially available system that specifically implements hybrid causal 
optimization as described in this study. Implementing this solution at scale across existing cement plants 
will require solving technical challenges such as sensor infrastructure requirements, integration with legacy 
control systems, and computing infrastructure limitations. The solution would also require adapting it to 
each plant's unique characteristics through extensive calibration, managing knowledge and expertise gaps 
amongst operators, and mitigating production continuity risks from testing new optimization. Other 
business challenges include ROI variability due to variations in implementation costs and energy prices 
across different plants, intellectual property protection, and organizational change management.

Addressing these challenges requires a phased implementation approach. It starts with plants that have 
modern control systems and robust data infrastructure and then standardized integration methods can 
eventually be developed that can be applied to more challenging environments.
5.6.6 Framework Validation and Reliability Analysis
Since direct implementation of the hybrid causal optimization framework has not been completed at 
the cement plant as at the time of this publication, this validation section employs complementary lines of 
evidence to assess framework reliability, robustness, and industrial applicability. This validation approach 
follows established practices in systems engineering for validating complex optimization frameworks prior 
to full-scale deployment.
98
I. Statistical Validation of Causal Discovery
1. Causal Relationship Significance Testing
The PCMCI algorithm provided robust statistical validation of discovered causal relationships (see 
Appendix item IV).
Significance levels achieved:
• Target variable VT showed 8 significant causal links with p-values ranging from 0.00 to 
0.00088.
• Variable V1 demonstrated 16 significant links with maximum p-value of 0.00588 at α = 0.01.
• Variable V2 exhibited 19 significant relationships with p-values consistently below 0.01
• Variables V3, V4, and V5 showed 29, 16, and 18 significant links respectively.
Cross-validation robustness:
The causal effect estimation using Random Forest cross-validation with K=5 folds demonstrated 
the following:
• Consistent causal effect estimates across all validation folds
• Low variance in effect estimates (standard deviation < 0.05 for major causal relationships)
• Stable causal graph structure across different data subsets
2. Temporal Stability Analysis
Time-lagged causal validation: The lag function matrix analysis (see Figure 18) shows stable causal 
relationships across multiple time horizons.
• Causal effects detected at lags 1-8 hours showing consistent directionality.
• Strongest causal effects concentrated at 1-2 hours lag, indicating immediate system responses.
• Temporal decay patterns are consistent with physical grinding process dynamics.
II. Cross-Validation through Feature Importance Analysis
1. Multiple Feature Selection Method Convergence
99
Validation through multiple feature importance methodologies showed consistent variable 
rankings. Chi-squared statistical test identified the following top variables. Runtime, Raw Mill Energy 
Consumption, Raw Mill Motor (scores: 1.14E+07, 3.81E+05, 2.40E+05), Total Raw Mill Feed, Raw 
Mill Fan Motor (scores: 2.29E+05, 2.02E+05). Extra Trees Classifier confirmed similar rankings. Raw 
Mill Motor and Fan Motor consistently ranked as top energy drivers. Material flow variables 
(limestone, sand) showed consistent importance across methods. Equipment health metrics (vibration, 
temperature) were validated as significant factors.
2. Causal Discovery Validation
Comparison between correlation-based and causal-based variable importance:
• Strong correlations confirmed as causal: Raw Mill Motor power showed both high 
correlation (r > 0.9) and significant causal effect (p < 0.001).
• Spurious correlations identified: Several highly correlated variables showed no 
significant causal relationship
• Hidden causal relationships discovered: Some weakly correlated variables demonstrated 
strong causal effects.
III. Expert Validation and Industrial Feasibility Assessment
1. Plant Operator Feedback Integration
Subject matter expert evaluation of optimization recommendations revealed that the parameter 
settings are feasible.
• Raw Mill Feed Rate: Optimal 682.28 tons per hour falls within equipment capacity (539.92 –
798 tons range).
• Fan Speed Settings: Recommendation 85.79 aligns with efficient operating range.
• Motor Power Levels: Suggested power consumption levels are within equipment ratings.
• Material Flow Rates: All recommended flow rates are achievable with existing conveyor 
systems.
100
• Production continuity: No recommendations violate process stability requirements.
2. Historical Performance Correlation
There is alignment with best practices when comparing the optimization recommendations with 
historical best performance periods.
• Energy consumption benchmarks: Optimized 11.40 kWh/t approaches theoretical minimum for this 
equipment configuration.
• Production efficiency: Recommended parameters align with historically successful operating 
periods.
• Equipment longevity: Parameter settings are consistent with practices that minimize equipment 
wear.
