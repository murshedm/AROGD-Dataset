Chapter 4 – Artificial Intelligence Applications in Electrical Energy Consumption 
Optimization
Despite its obvious purpose, research on the implementation of electrical energy–saving measures at 
the plant level has been surprisingly slow. Hence, this systematic literature review aims to articulate the 
following:
1. The research that has been done and the methods that have been investigated in the optimization of 
EEC in cement manufacturing.
2. The contributions of previous investigations to EEC optimization and the gaps that need to be 
addressed.
3. The application of AI, and other methods and approaches applied to EEC optimization in other power–
consumption heavy industries.
4. The potential areas of future research in cement manufacturing EEC optimization, and the inherent 
opportunities to leverage AI applications.
At the nexus of sustainability and industrial development, cement manufacturing presents a unique 
challenge in curbing energy consumption without compromising the quality and quantity of production. 
This study contextualizes the significance of optimizing EEC, addressing the industry's demand and its 
implications for environmental sustainability. The rationale behind this study stems from the urgency to 
reduce the environmental impact of cement manufacturing while ensuring its operational efficiency [18, 
20]. The electric power the cement plants consume is significant, and the generation of the electricity 
consumed contributes to the carbon footprint due to the indirect impact of the power plant which uses either 
fossil fuel or natural gas to generate electricity. There are research efforts on alternative ways to generate 
electricity; however, there seem not to be as many research efforts focused on optimizing electricity 
consumption in cement manufacturing. Analyzing and synthesizing the existing body of knowledge is
46
pivotal to identifying gaps, novel advancements, and future directions for optimizing EEC in this vital 
industry. This study aims to critically examine and consolidate insights from a wide array of scholarly 
articles, industry reports, and research studies. 
Discovering a dearth of research on the optimization of EEC in cement manufacturing, this literature 
review explores approaches adopted in other industries with high power demand. It further explores the 
relatively untapped potential for leveraging artificial intelligence to optimize EEC in cement manufacturing. 
Thus, it contributes to the evolving discourse on sustainable practices within cement manufacturing and 
endeavors to identify opportunities for innovation, foster informed decision–making, and propel the cement 
manufacturing industry toward a more energy–efficient and environmentally conscious future.
4.1 Literature Review Method
The systematic review process described in [99] was adopted for this study. The first stage of the 
process includes identifying a need for a review and developing a review protocol. In the second stage, we 
select the papers, assess their quality, and extract and synthesize data and relevant information. The final 
stage involves analyzing and interpreting the content, reporting the findings, and making recommendations 
for further research. The article selection process was streamlined into four steps: keyword selection, 
relevant database search, criteria–based shortlisting of articles, and selection of articles for in–depth review.
We selected search terms from the scoping study and discussions within the review team to conduct a 
comprehensive and unbiased search. The keywords and term adopted was “electric energy consumption 
optimization in cement manufacturing" to identify contributions related to electric power optimization, 
specifically in cement manufacturing. The keywords selected stem from the main concept of the area of 
study and it is intended to aid the identification and location of relevant literature and resources from various 
databases and search engines.
All contribution types, including articles, conference papers, and literature reviews published between 
1993 and 2023, were considered, and relevant ones were included in the study. The search was conducted 
47
across Google Scholar, Scopus, IEEE EXplore, and PhilPapers databases. These databases contain 
scholarly resources relevant to the search topic
The most relevant 120 from a sample of peer–reviewed publications matched on Google Scholar (each 
with at least 100 citations) were assessed. Most of the matches came from a match on power optimization; 
however, most were not cement manufacturing applications. Other relevant articles were selected from 
Scopus, IEEE EXplore, and PhilPapers databases. The literature survey indicates that studies on power 
consumption optimization in cement manufacturing are limited in number and scope, and that this paper 
can contribute to a better understanding of strategies for optimizing EEC in cement manufacturing. The 
selection criteria are summarized in Table 5 below.

Research articles were identified and selected based on their focus and relevance to power optimization 
in cement manufacturing. Then, we did a backward–forward search by reviewing the references of the 
articles in our initial selection and identifying relevant articles that cited the ones in our initial sample [100]. 
After screening titles and abstracts, full–text articles were reviewed for eligibility, and 25 papers were 
finalized for detailed analysis. These papers’ full texts were evaluated in detail to identify the main themes 
and perspectives. Figure 14 highlights the steps adopted for selecting the literature reviewed.

Figure 14. Literature selection
In comparison to applications in cement manufacturing found in literature, we reviewed the applications 
of AI to EEC optimization in manufacturing industries that have a heavy demand for electric power, 
including metals and mining, chemicals and petrochemicals, electronics and semiconductors, food and 
beverage processing, pulp and paper, automotive and transportation equipment, and textiles and apparel.
The quality assessments adopted include exploring and comparing different sources of knowledge for 
data quality, reviewing theoretical adequacy, and confirming that the claims made are generalizable 
logically and theoretically from the data [99]. Our analysis followed the descriptive design highlighted in 
the structuring content analysis approach of [101], which analyzes the texts to find the power optimization 
categories and register the occurrence of the categories. For instance, the adoption of power–efficient 
equipment occurred frequently in the literature, suggesting significant cumulative power–saving effects 
from implementing multiple strategies. 
We organized the discussion on power–efficient equipment around processes in the different heavy 
power consumption subsystems of cement manufacturing. These include general electrical power 
management, gas handling and pneumatic systems, motors and transmissions, and comminution and 
separation. Other major categories in the literature include automation and process control along with 
adopting Industry 4.0 concepts. These categories formed the key themes around which we frame our 
findings in the following section.
49
4.2 Literature Review Results
The literature review findings will be presented and discussed in the following sub–paragraphs 
identifying opportunities for EEC in electric power management, gas handling and pneumatic systems, 
motors and transmissions, and comminution and separation. First, we provide a descriptive analysis of 
relevant literature. Subsequently, we describe energy–saving opportunities from the cumulative effect of 
adopting power–efficient equipment. Then, we highlight the opportunities within other categories, such as 
automation and process control, digitalization, and adoption of Industry 4.0 concepts. We also examine 
how other industries that have heavy demand for electrical energy implement EEC optimization by 
leveraging AI. The potential role of advanced analytics and AI in achieving electric power optimization in 
cement manufacturing specifically is further discussed, focusing on its potential to be leveraged for energy 
data analysis, predictive modeling, process optimization, and integration with energy management systems.
4.2.1 Descriptive Results
The research trend (Figure 15) indicates recent interest in electrical energy optimization in cement 
manufacturing. There is a recent increase in awareness of the importance of energy conservation and 
environmental protection. With EEC accounting for more than 60% of the total consumption and the higher 
cost of electricity linearly increasing the cost of production [18], energy conservation in cement 
manufacturing is key to the economical and sustainable production of cement. Optimizing electrical energy 
consumption in the production process can improve energy efficiency, reduce operational costs, and 
mitigate environmental impacts. It is worthy of note that all nine of the shortlisted publications that are 
focused on digitalization and the application of Industry 4.0 concepts were all published between 2018 and 
2023, and involve the use of simulation, modeling, or analytics.
Table 6 groups the literature [102–123, 8] into the different electrical energy–saving categories 
elaborated in the papers. Many of the papers covered multiple categories, compared potential energy–saving 
opportunities, and aligned with the concept of accumulating power savings by adopting multiple power–
saving methods.

4.2.2 Energy-saving Opportunities
The raw materials preparation process in cement manufacturing which includes quarrying, crushing, 
grinding and the blending of limestone with other materials, the calcination in the kiln, clinker cooling, 
and the final cement grinding are all electrical-energy intensive processes. Figure 16 is a schematic 
representation of the cement manufacturing process showing the electrical-energy intensive processes and 
emissions. The following subsections describe some of the energy–saving opportunities applicable to the 
cement production process.

4.2.2.1. Energy efficient equipment and technologies
Advocacy for adopting energy–efficient equipment was found to be common in literature within the 
period in consideration. As cement manufacturing equipment technology evolved, the advances were 
applied to curtail electricity costs by reducing specific power usage [102 –105]. Before the first period 
(1993–1999), there were improvements in fuel energy requirements, and the adoption of alternative fuels 
increased, while specific electrical energy consumption increased by as much as 40%. Many cement plants 
in Europe and North America at the time had higher electrical bills than fuel bills. The high bills drove 
innovations that created power reduction opportunities within electrical power management, gas handling 
and pneumatic systems, motors and transmissions, and comminution and separation [102].

With modern electrical power management technology, cement plants are digitalized, and 
computerized monitoring of motors and starters is implemented so that all the data collected can be analyzed 
to develop control strategies. These data–driven power management strategies include production planning 
to shift loads and maximize on–peak and off–peak demand power rates, preventing unnecessary equipment 
idling, and studying the causes of power variation.
Worrell et al., in their research [103], examined strategies for decreasing energy consumption and 
carbon dioxide emissions in US cement production by gathering data on the costs, energy conservation, and 
reductions in carbon dioxide emissions associated with various technologies and approaches. These 
methods were classified into two groups: existing measures widely adopted in cement plants globally and 
innovative measures that were either minimally implemented or on the brink of commercial viability. Using
an energy conservation supply curve, the authors assessed the cost–effectiveness of the potential for 
improving energy efficiency. Energy conservation supply curves compare investments in energy 
conservation against investments in energy supply to take the least–cost approach to meeting energy needs. 
According to the findings, switching products to blended cement resulted in total fuel savings of 1.41 GJ/t 
of blended cement but an estimated increase in electricity consumption by 17kWh/t from grinding the 
blending materials. Estimated electricity savings from energy–efficient technologies for cement making in 
the US in 1994 ranged from 0.03 GJ/t from using high–efficiency roller mills to 0.07 GJ/t from adopting 
heat recovery for power generation. The International Energy Agency reported that from 2010 to 2020, the 
thermal energy intensity of clinker decreased by 0.2% annually [11]. However, it has since plateaued at 
around 3.6 GJ/t. This decline brought a rise in the sector's electricity intensity, estimated at 100kWh/t 
cement since 2022. This indicates that some of the advancements in thermal energy efficiency in cement 
manufacturing resulted in increased electrical energy consumption within the sector.
Common to many of the papers reviewed is an advocacy for the adoption of methods that have the 
potential to save energy. Al–Mansour et al. [104] submitted that prompt activation of savings opportunities 
yields economic advantages and reduces both direct and indirect greenhouse gas emissions. The analysis 
53
of Slovenia from 1997 to 2020 illustrated that promptly implementing energy efficiency measures in the 
industrial sector is economically justified. Using analytical methods with a 'least cost' economics analysis 
approach, the authors opined that enhancements to internal industrial conversion systems, such as the co–
generation of electricity and heat, contribute significantly to overall efficiency improvements. The 'least 
cost' method identifies the scope for cost–effective energy savings as a function of energy cost and 
investment criteria.
The report in [105] is a guide for energy and plant managers that covers more than forty energy–
efficient technologies implemented in cement plants worldwide. It assesses the technologies' effectiveness 
in terms of energy and carbon dioxide savings, investment costs, and operation and maintenance expenses. 
It recommends a corporate–wide energy management program that advocates for changes in staff behavior 
and attitude, energy efficiency training programs, and a formal management structure for managing energy. 
Energy–efficient technologies are often combined with process controls to reduce energy consumption 
and carbon emissions [106–107]. Madlool et al. [106] surveyed energy efficiency measures for raw 
materials preparation, clinker production, products and feedstock changes, and finish grinding. Table 7 
summarizes the estimated electrical energy savings and emission reductions reported in the paper from 
energy efficiency measures at each stage of the cement manufacturing process. The study indicated that as 
of 2013, the largest recorded amount of electrical energy savings from the adoption of energy efficiency 
methods was 35kW h/t.
One factor that should be addressed when implementing efficiency improvements in the manufacturing 
process is the economic viability of the proposed improvements. In a study that presented energy–saving 
measures with varying degrees of complexity and investment requirements, cost savings achieved surpassed 
the investment cost of implementing actions by 0.9 million USD [107].

Implementing energy–efficient technologies led to a 10.45% reduction in electrical energy 
consumption between 2008 and 2010. Notably, the improvements in process control techniques introduced 
during the same period resulted in substantial energy savings, with a 22.6% improvement in specific 
electrical energy consumption. 
The authors employed the cumulative sum of differences technique to evaluate the effectiveness of the 
implemented actions. Therefore, with this know–how, there is an argument to be made that the cement 
manufacturing industry will gain much in cost savings and reduce CO2 indirect impact by looking at 
innovative ways to optimize electrical usage at the plant level.
The articles reviewed indicate that the adoption of energy-efficient equipment and technologies in 
cement manufacturing has the potential to reduce energy consumption, electricity costs, and carbon dioxide 
emissions. Also, it is important to ascertain the economic viability of efficiency improvements to ensure 
manufacturer’s motivation to implement.
4.2.2.2 Pyro–processing, grinding and milling opportunities
Quarry crushing is the start of the preparation of the raw material needed for the manufacturing of 
cement. The crushing process which also consists of conveying blasted limestone material consumes 
electricity because of motor drives. The process accounts for a small percentage compared to the other 
processes. Raw material milling, which follows the quarry crushing to reduce the material to fines for 
cement manufacturing also consumes electricity because of the raw mill motor drive. Compared to the other 
processes, however, it is a small percentage. Pyroprocessing is a term used to describe the high-temperature 
thermal treatments that occur during cement manufacturing. The processes involve using intense heat to 
transform grounded raw materials into clinker, the primary component of cement. Considerable electrical 
energy is required to power the kiln drive system motors and gears, the preheater and pre-calciner systems 
fans and blowers, the clinker cooler system, and the numerous auxiliary equipment such as air compressors, 
pumps, lighting, and control systems. In a study, raw material processing, clinker burning, and clinker 
grinding accounted for 28%, 25%, and 32% of electrical energy consumption, respectively [107]. Demand-
56
side energy management measures can provide immediate and short-term improvements in energy 
efficiency. Examples of these measures include leveraging free and low-cost options such as motor, 
compressed air, and process heater optimization software tools, energy management training programs, and 
energy assessments and audits.
After the clinker has been cooled, it’s stored in clinker domes or silos, in storage bins or heaps outside. 
It is conveyed to storage, and to the finish mill for further grinding, using belt conveyors, deep bucket 
conveyors or bucket elevators, which can also dump it directly into silos or bins for shipment. To produce 
powdery cement, the nodules are ground to a fine powdery consistency. Approximately 3‑5 per cent gypsum 
is added to regulate the setting properties of the cement. These powders, clinker and gypsum, are ground in 
ball mills or a combination of ball mills and roller presses, in roller mills, or roller presses Vertical roller 
mills are technically feasible, but they have yet to be widely accepted in the US. Coarse material generated 
by all these systems is screened and returned to the mill for further grinding to ensure a uniform surface 
area of the final product. The electrical power required to grind the raw material depends on the required 
surface area of the final product, the additives used, the hardness of the materials used (principally the 
limestone, clinker, pozzolana extenders), and the desired fineness of the cement [105]. 
In a study of a methodology to shift electricity consumption to economical off-peak periods, various 
physical components such as the raw mill, the kiln, crushers, cement mill, and auxiliary equipment were 
integrated into a simulation model to accurately predict their influence on production and cost [108]. Utlu 
et al. [109] examined pyroprocessing energy-saving opportunities in a Turkish cement plant using actual 
operational data. They proposed a tool for the analysis of energy and exergy utilization, the development 
of energy policies, and the provision of energy conservation measures. However, delivering energyefficient technologies to consumers effectively is a challenge.
The pyroprocessing, grinding, and milling processes involved in cement manufacturing are energyintensive due to the significant electrical energy consumed by the equipment such as motors, fans, mills, 
and conveyors. Some of the potential energy management measures recommended in articles include the 
57
use of optimization software, energy audits, shifting electricity consumption to off-peak periods, and the 
analysis of energy and exergy utilization data for the development of conservation measures.
4.2.2.3 Raw material, recycling, circular economy
More recent research efforts indicate that value can be derived from adopting recycling and the circular 
economy concept. The findings in [110] provide an estimate that recycled cement production using cement 
paste from concrete waste consumes 30% less energy than clinker production. The electrical energy 
consumption for an industrial setup is estimated by extrapolating laboratory results through simulations and 
analogies. The energy requirement is approximately one-third lower than conventional methods, as the 
concrete waste is already pre-crushed, thus reducing the need for extensive crushing to obtain fine 
aggregates. Additionally, the weaker nature of concrete waste compared to natural rock further contributes 
to the lower energy demand. However, compared to clinker, using concrete waste as a substitute has 
limitations that necessitate further investigation to comprehend the differences fully. While concrete waste 
exhibits lower reactivity and potentially lower strength characteristics, it has demonstrated acceptable 
results when used to replace up to 40% of Portland cement. Ambient air temperature and moisture content 
of the raw material also affect the performance of the raw mill and, in effect, the energy consumption. First 
and second law efficiencies of raw mill increase as ambient temperature increases and the moisture content 
of the raw materials decreases [111].
In summary, research suggests cement production from recycled concrete waste has the potential 
to reduce energy consumption when compared to conventional clinker production, however its possible 
limitations in strength and reactivity are worthy of further investigation. 
4.2.2.4. Waste heat recovery and electric power generation
Researchers have explored waste heat recovery to generate power for cement manufacturing, as the 
process is energy-intensive and generates significant amounts of waste heat [112-114]. Mirhosseini et al. 
[114] confirm the feasibility and economic viability of generating electricity using thermoelectric 
58
generators (TEG) at the cement rotary kiln. The researchers propose installing a metallic frame acting as an 
absorber around the cement kiln, maintaining a specific gap from the kiln surface. This configuration serves 
two purposes: firstly, it facilitates heat recovery by thermoelectric generators, and secondly, it prevents the 
kiln from experiencing excessive temperature rise and additional weight. The study presents an optimal 
TEG system design that maximizes power generation by dividing the arc-shaped absorber into ten distinct 
sections. For each section, the study calculates the optimal design parameters for the TEG and 
corresponding heat sink, ensuring efficient heat transfer and electricity production.
Sanaye et al. [112] highlighted procedures for the modeling and optimum design of waste heat recovery 
and power generation systems. The modeling covered energy, exergy, economic, and environmental 
aspects. They reported on two parallel lines of cement production that were new and specific to the cement 
plant studied and leveraged a genetic algorithm for multi-objective optimization. The study's Organic 
Rankine cycle results showed that using water as a working fluid provided 9.14MW power output with an 
exergy destruction ratio of 47.9%. In contrast, using toluene as a working fluid provided a 6.56MW power 
output with an exergy destruction ratio of 53.5%.
Sani et al. implemented waste heat recovery by installing an air-quenching chamber at the clinker 
cooler's output and incorporating suspension preheater boilers in the preheating stage [113]. A genetic 
algorithm was employed to determine the optimal energy and exergy performance evaluation parameters, 
considering three different working fluids: water, refrigerant R123, and refrigerant R245fa. By optimizing 
the use of refrigerant R123, the power generation capacity increased significantly from 5MW to 9MW, 
whereas utilizing water as the working fluid only resulted in a modest increase from 4.8MW to 5MW. 
Furthermore, the analysis revealed that the refrigerant R123 exhibited a 4.1% decrease in total exergy loss, 
indicating its suitability as an efficient working fluid for cement plants' waste heat recovery cycle.
In summary, the feasibility and optimal design of waste recovery systems for generating electricity in 
cement manufacturing has been investigated by researchers. The approaches they have proposed include 
using TEG around the rotary kiln, incorporating air-quenching chamber at the clinker cooler’s output, and 
suspension preheater boilers in the pre-heating stage.
59
4.2.2.5 Automation and Process Control
Automation and advanced process control systems are critical for optimizing electrical energy usage in 
cement manufacturing. The cement production process is highly energy-intensive, with massive equipment 
consuming vast amounts of electricity. About two-thirds of the total electrical energy is used to reduce the 
particle size of raw materials and clinker. Practical methods to optimize the efficiency of the cement ball 
mill (CBM) were explored in a study of its energy and exergy in a new-generation cement plant [115]. The 
electrical energy consumption of the CBM unit was initially specified at 37.9 kWh/t. The study investigated 
the impact of factors such as ball charge pattern, cement fineness, and the addition of limestone and 
pozzolan on the performance of the CBM unit and the quality of the produced cement. By modifying the 
ball charge pattern, the first and second law efficiencies of the CBM increased to 81.8% and 20.6%, 
respectively, while the electrical energy consumption of the CBM unit decreased to 36.5 kWh/t. 
Furthermore, the results demonstrated that as the cement fineness decreased from 3250 cm2/g to 2820 
cm2/g, the cement production rate increased from 185 t/h to 224 t/h, and the electrical energy consumption 
decreased from 41.1 kWh/t to 33.1 kWh/t. However, reducing the cement fineness affected the cement 
compressive strength (at 3, 7, and 28 days), which decreased while the cement setting time (initial and final) 
increased.
Gangwar et al. [116] developed a simulation-optimization method for scheduling energy-intensive 
industries under the uncertainty of the spot electricity market. This method, which can be adopted by the 
cement manufacturing industry for optimizing electricity costs, uses a Monte-Carlo scenario generator to 
generate future electricity prices and calculates the potential outputs for each of the plausible forecasted 
electricity price scenarios independently. Overall, the model identified the most profitable ways to operate 
an air separation plant in Spain under the uncertainty of electricity prices in the future.
By implementing automated control systems, parameters like equipment speeds, temperatures, and 
material flow rates can be dynamically adjusted based on real-time feedback to operate at peak efficiency. 
This prevents inefficient manual operation that wastes energy. Additionally, machine learning and artificial 
60
intelligence capabilities can be integrated to predict ideal operating setpoints and detect anomalies that 
increase energy drain. Automated monitoring also enables predictive maintenance, reducing unplanned 
outages and optimizing planned downtime for maintenance - avoiding wasteful energy consumption from 
faulty equipment. With rising energy costs and pressures to decarbonize, investing in automation and 
process control yields compounding paybacks through electrical energy savings while enhancing product 
quality, throughput, and environmental sustainability of cement production.
4.2.2.6. Digitalization
Potential benefits of digitalizing cement manufacturing include energy optimization, process 
automation and control, predictive maintenance, supply chain optimization, remote monitoring and control, 
product quality control, and data-driven decision-making. While digitalization requires upfront investments 
in technologies, systems, and skills, the potential benefits from efficiency improvements can result in 
significant cost savings, improved quality, and enhanced sustainability. Another potential benefit of 
digitalization is the standardization of data which allows the exchange, comparison, and integration of 
content between different parties in the industry. These provide valuable opportunities for cement 
manufacturers to remain competitive and adaptable to changing market demands.
Several research findings confirm the potential value of digitalization, subsequent data collection, and 
application of advanced analytics to the cement manufacturing process. In one instance, implementing 
model predictive control (MPC) technologies drove power consumption reductions ranging from 3% to 
8%, simultaneously enabling increased production output and reduced fuel consumption rates [117]. In this 
study, two cement-related industrial MPC applications were presented – a cement raw-mix blending 
application and a cement mill grinding MPC application. A linear model predictive control algorithm with 
soft constraints was applied. By leveraging predictive modeling and optimization algorithms, MPC 
technologies can optimize various process parameters, improving electrical energy efficiency, and higher 
throughput, contributing to cost savings and sustainability goals.
61
Tong et al. [118] introduced the digitization work of a smart cement plant in China, which implemented 
intelligent factory technology using special integrated robots, software-as-a-service-based cement process 
digital applicant, artificial intelligence (XGBoost classifier), and advanced process control. Introducing 
these technologies gave potential energy savings ranging from 2% to 5% from improved process control. 
The primary production process in cement manufacturing is continuous, making process operation 
optimization or real-time optimization a crucial aspect. In their paper, Zhu et al. [119] presented a real-time 
optimization method based on system identification, which is particularly well-suited for energy and utility 
systems in cement plants. The proposed approach does not require rigorous mathematical models or 
specialized performance tests, making it a cost-effective solution. By leveraging system identification 
techniques, this method can optimize processes without complex modeling or extensive testing, thereby 
providing an efficient and economical way to enhance energy and utility systems in cement production.
In another study that shows the role that simulations and modeling can play in improving production, 
simulations and modeling studies were conducted to evaluate modifications to the existing cement grinding 
circuit flowsheet [120]. The proposed modifications involved redirecting the mill filter stream to the final 
product silo instead of sending it to the classifier feed. The simulations indicated that this modification 
would lead to a 4.45% increase in production rate, resulting in corresponding energy savings of 4.26%. 
This optimization approach not only improved energy efficiency but also enhanced the quality of the end 
product. Extensive investigations, laboratory validations, and post-production surveys were undertaken to 
validate the effectiveness of the modifications and ensure that product quality was not compromised. The 
results confirmed that the proposed changes did not adversely impact the quality of the cement product 
while delivering the anticipated benefits of increased production capacity and energy savings. Similarly, in 
another study, the specific electricity consumption of the raw mill workshop of a cement plant in Morocco 
was optimized while ensuring mill stability and quality control [122]. A multilinear regression model was 
used to test the effect of the independent variables mill throughput, hydraulic pressure, and mill outlet 
temperature against target variables of mill-specific electricity consumption and mill vibration.

Ye et al. [122] focused their study on modeling the primary energy-consuming equipment in cement 
manufacturing plants by utilizing industrial load characteristics and implementing a Markov process model. 
Subsequently, they used reinforcement learning algorithms to design demand response scheduling methods 
tailored for industrial applications. By combining the equipment modeling approach with advanced 
machine learning techniques, the study demonstrated intelligent energy management strategies that can 
optimize electrical energy consumption and enable demand response capabilities in energy-intensive 
cement manufacturing facilities. Artificial neural networks and genetic algorithms have also been applied 
to reduce the cost of electricity by optimizing different variables in the production process and regulated 
electricity market costs [123].
The best way for the cement industry to confront the challenges facing it and improve operational 
excellence is to embrace technological advances and innovations [8, 124]. The cement industry's major 
challenges include cost reduction, environmental protection, and energy/capital efficiency. Technological 
advances under the "Industrial Internet of Things" paradigm can be leveraged to address these challenges. 
These include process automation, engineering software, data collection/analysis platforms, secure data 
transportation, and storage solutions that provide real-time information for informed decision-making, help 
improve asset utilization and optimize relationships with customers and suppliers.
4.2.3. Leveraging AI for EEC optimization in other manufacturing industries
Research efforts have been directed at reducing electrical energy consumption in other manufacturing 
industries whose operations have a high demand for electrical energy, but this is lacking in the cement 
manufacturing industry. There is evidence in the literature that AI can improve energy efficiency by 
increasing technological efficiency [125-127]. For instance, in the metals and mining industry, the furnaces, 
electrolytic processes, and other energy-intensive operations required for smelting and refining metals like 
steel, copper, and aluminum consume considerable amounts of electrical energy. Artificial intelligence 
solutions were leveraged in an initiative that helped a steel manufacturer drive higher profit margins while 
meeting quality and quantity demand at reduced energy consumption levels. Pattern recognition and 
63
predictive modeling was applied to signals from sensors embedded in the mill to predict demand flow, asset 
flow, wear rates, and high-expense consumables used in production [128].
The production of various chemicals, plastics, and petrochemicals uses electric motors, pumps, fans 
and blowers, compressors, and compressed air systems. Motor systems use about 57% of the total electricity 
used in the chemical industry. 26% of the electricity is used by pumps, 23.6% is used in material processing, 
27.7% by compressed air systems, 11.9% by fans, and 7.7% by refrigeration systems. Researchers have 
developed and tested a method that leverages descriptive analytics and neural network modeling to optimize 
the use of energy resources in chemical production [129]. Similarly, data analytics has been applied to 
optimize EEC in smart food processing achieving a 12% reduction in energy consumption and CO2 
emissions [130]. Optimization algorithms, mixed data sampling regression, and genetic algorithms have 
been used to reduce the electrical energy consumed in mechanical pulp production in the papermaking 
industry [131]. It is essential that the cement industry explore this novel idea to optimize its electrical 
consumption. No literature work was found during this work which shows that AI has been adopted by the 
cement industry to help optimize electrical consumption as other industries have done.
4.3 EEC Optimization Discussion
Infrastructural changes required at the cement plant to implement energy optimization often require 
significant capital investments [8]. Replacing aging equipment with more modern energy-efficient 
equipment and technologies often requires significant financial and human capital. Cement quality 
requirements are a constraint to swapping out or recycling raw materials. The adoption of automation and 
process control in cement manufacturing is getting attention. However, the fully autonomous cement plant 
is still a distant reality [132]. With innovation in sensors, interconnection of machines, automation devices, 
techniques based on IIoT, and advancement in cloud data storage and computing, large volumes of data on 
the operations of the cement plant can be collected. Even a staged implementation of digitalization in 
cement manufacturing can yield immediate, cost-effective results by applying advanced analytics to the 
data to generate transformative insights.
64
Table 8 is a synthesis of analytics methods applied in the literature for power optimization in cement 
manufacturing. The methods involve modeling and/or simulation of the electrical energy-intensive cement 
manufacturing process and applying a statistical method, an algorithm, or an optimization method to the 
model. Researchers have explored model predictive control applications [117], intelligent factory 
technology applications [118], real-time optimization [119], multilinear regression model [121], and 
reinforcement learning [122]. 
Energy data can be analyzed to uncover opportunities to reduce EEC. Cement plants generate massive 
amounts of data from various sources, including energy meters, process sensors, and control systems. 
Advanced analytics techniques can be employed to analyze this data and uncover patterns, trends, and 
insights related to energy consumption. This analysis can help identify energy hotspots, inefficiencies, and 
opportunities for optimization. By leveraging historical data and machine learning algorithms, predictive 
models can be developed to forecast energy demand, production rates, and equipment performance. These 
models can assist in optimizing energy usage by anticipating fluctuations in demand and adjusting 
operations accordingly, minimizing energy waste and peak loads. The output of the models can be 
incorporated into energy management systems that monitor and control energy consumption across the 
plant.
The use of digital twins and simulation in manufacturing is gaining attention. A high-fidelity digital 
twin of the cement grinding circuit can be developed using physics-based models and machine learning. 
Simulations can then be performed to test strategies for energy optimization before implementing them in 
the actual plant. Digital twins can also be used for virtual commissioning and operator training to improve 
human-process interaction efficiency.
The applications of AI to process optimization should be explored further for electric energy-saving 
opportunities in cement manufacturing. Advanced analytics can be used to optimize various processes 
within the cement plant, such as raw material grinding, clinker production, and cement grinding. By 
analyzing data from sensors and meters across the grinding circuit (mill, separators, fans, conveyors), we 
65
can determine the optimal setpoints and operating parameters (mill speed, feed rate, airflow) that minimize 
specific energy consumption while maintaining product quality.

The production line of modern cement plants can be partitioned into these four sub-processes: crushing, 
kiln feed preparation, clinker production, and finish grinding. The cement manufacturing process heavily 
relies on electricity for various operations, such as crushing and grinding the raw materials, transporting 
substantial volumes of gases and materials throughout the facility, and grinding the final cement product. 
The electricity consumption of a grinding workshop is typically modeled as a function of the power demand 
of the equipment and the throughput of the material in the mill feed [121]. The objective is to optimize 
specific electricity consumption while keeping the mill operation stable and the product quality and 
production quantity according to plan. Effectively reducing electricity consumption reduces the carbon 
footprint due to the indirect impact of the electricity generating power plants which use either fossil fuel or 
natural gas. At a high level, the design of the optimization experiment will include the following:
• Identifying and modeling of the electrical energy-intensive components of the production process 
[133]. 
• Data measurement and collection of mill-controlled and manipulated parameters such as crushers, 
conveyors, mill motor and fan power, vibration, bed material height, residue fineness, mill throughput, 
mill output temperature, mill roller hydraulic pressure, mill fan speed, and separator speed. This will 
require the installation of sensors and meters where necessary.
• Exploratory data analysis is used to find patterns and uncover insights, helping to determine the linear 
and non-linear relationships of variables with the objective function and the optimization methods to 
experiment with.
