Chapter 6 – Research Summary and Recommendations, Future Work, Conclusion
Cement manufacturing challenges are highlighted in Chapter 1 of this dissertation, the literature review 
in Chapter 2, and the resulting author publications highlight that the cement industry stands at a critical 
intersection of global development and environmental sustainability. The study includes findings on 
potential decarbonization with production input substitutions at a cement plant. The finding is that while 
significant attention has been paid to reducing CO2 emissions from the chemical conversion process and 
thermal energy usage, the electrical energy consumption in cement production has received comparatively 
less focus despite its significant contribution to the industry's carbon footprint. As already demonstrated in 
this study, a modern cement plant consumes up to 110kWh of electricity to produce a ton of cement, 
resulting in substantial indirect carbon emissions from power generation. For the United States alone, this 
translated to approximately 4.47 million tons of CO2 in 2022 from the electricity used in cement production.
6.1 Research Summary and Recommendations
To address the gap in electrical energy optimization in the cement industry, this study takes a holistic 
approach to engineering sustainability improvements in the cement industry. It studies the cement 
production process as a system of systems and applies systems engineering methodologies and advanced 
analytics to tackle this challenge through interconnected studies, as summarized below.
Chapter 2 covers the environmental challenges and technical optimization approaches to provide a 
rounded foundation for the dissertation. The comprehensive literature review focused on two main areas:
1. Cement manufacturing sustainability challenges and approaches
2. Optimization methods can improve electrical energy efficiency and, as a result, sustainability. The 
emphasis was on optimization using causal inference techniques that can be applied as interventions at 
the cement plant.

The chapter first establishes cement manufacturing as a significant contributor to global greenhouse 
gas emissions, highlighting environmental impact factors, including carbon emissions, energy 
consumption, raw material usage, and pollution. It then reviews current sustainability approaches in the 
industry, such as carbon capture and storage, alternative fuels, waste heat recovery, and process 
modifications.
The second part examines optimization methods, focusing on Iterative Causal Inference (ICI) and 
Causal Bayesian Optimization (CBO) as sophisticated approaches to understanding cause-effect 
relationships in complex manufacturing systems. These methods are promising tools for optimizing 
electrical energy consumption in cement production.
Chapter 3 presents a framework for continuously assessing the environmental impact and economic 
viability of decarbonization improvements in cement manufacturing. The research introduces a 
methodology combining Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) and Techno-Economic Assessment (TEA) to 
evaluate four production scenarios at a US cement plant, considering both material substitution and 
alternative fuel sources.
The study demonstrates the following:
1. Environmental Impact Analysis: Portland-limestone cement (PLC) production has a 6.4% lower carbon 
footprint than ordinary Portland cement (OPC), reducing emissions from 856 to 801 kg CO₂-eq/ton.
2. Alternative Fuel Benefits: Using dried biosolids from sewage sludge instead of coal for thermal energy 
provides further emission reductions. The combined use of PLC and dried biosolids yields a 7.9% total 
carbon reduction compared to traditional OPC with coal.
3. Economic Viability: PLC production using dried biosolids can reduce manufacturing costs by 10.87% 
(from $58.69 to $52.31 per ton), showing that environmental improvements can yield economic 
benefits.
103
4. Optimization Potential: The research identifies optimal production volumes and examines cost 
sensitivities to factors like electricity prices and production scale, finding an inflection point at 800,000 
tons annual production where economies of scale stabilize.
5. Deployment Framework: A practical implementation approach is proposed using IoT-enabled devices, 
cloud computing, and Python-based analytics to continuously monitor and optimize production 
parameters for environmental and economic outcomes.
The framework leverages digitalization and data-driven optimization to help cement manufacturers 
dynamically manage their production inputs, reduce emissions, and make informed decisions about process 
improvements.
Chapter 4 presents a systematic literature review examining EEC optimization in cement 
manufacturing, focusing on artificial intelligence applications. The research spans literature from 1993-
2023 and identifies the following key approaches to electrical energy optimization:
1. Energy-efficient equipment and technologies: Modern equipment can yield a 10.45% reduction in 
electrical energy consumption, with process control improvements driving up to a 22.6% improvement 
in specific electrical energy consumption.
2. Pyro-processing, grinding, and milling optimizations consume approximately 85% of total electrical 
energy in cement plants (28% for raw material processing, 25% for clinker burning, and 32% for clinker 
grinding).
3. Recycling and circular economy approach: Recycled cement production using concrete waste can 
consume 30% less energy than conventional clinker production.
4. Waste heat recovery systems: Converting waste heat to electricity using thermoelectric generators can 
generate significant power (5-9MW).
104
5. Automation and process control: Modern control systems optimize equipment speeds, temperatures, 
and material flow rates, with Model Predictive Control (MPC) technologies reducing power 
consumption by 3-8%.
6. Digitalization and AI applications: Machine learning techniques, including reinforcement learning, 
digital twins, and predictive modeling, have shown significant energy savings in other industries but 
remain underutilized in cement manufacturing.
Chapter 5 presents research on optimizing EEC in cement raw meal grinding through advanced 
industrial analytics and causal inference methods. The study focuses on raw meal grinding, which accounts 
for up to 27% of a cement plant's electricity demand. It is a significant opportunity for energy efficiency 
improvements and carbon reduction.
The study introduces a novel "Hybrid Causal Optimization" approach that combines the strengths of 
iterative causal inference and Causal Bayesian Optimization (CBO) while addressing their limitations. This 
innovative method analyzed over 30,300 hours of operational data from a cement plant, modeling the 
complex relationships between dozens of process variables. Key findings include the following:
1. Significant Energy Reduction Potential: The Hybrid Causal Optimization approach identified operating 
parameters that could reduce specific electrical energy consumption (SEEC) by 26.7%, from an 
observed average of 15.55 kWh/t to an optimized 11.40 kWh/t.
2. Causal Relationships Matter: By identifying true causal relationships rather than mere correlations, the 
model surfaced actionable interventions that reduce energy consumption while maintaining product 
quality.
3. Substantial Sustainability Impact: For a cement plant producing 3.13 million tons annually, the 26.7% 
electricity reduction in raw meal grinding translates to approximately 10.5 million pounds of CO₂ 
emissions avoided.
105
4. Compelling Economic Benefits: Implementing the recommended optimization could save 
approximately $1.69 million annually in electricity costs. The payback period is 3.5-7.1 months, and 
the first-year ROI is 169-338%.
5. Industry-Leading Performance: The optimized SEEC of 11.40 kWh/t falls within the "best practice" 
range (10-14 kWh/t) for raw material grinding, representing a significant improvement over the 
industry average (14-18 kWh/t).
This research has demonstrated that understanding causal relationships, rather than merely correlations, 
is essential for effective cement raw meal grinding electrical energy consumption optimization. The novel 
framework developed here showed success on the following:
• Identifies true causal drivers of EEC in a complex manufacturing system.
• Handles real-world disturbances and variations that defeat traditional approaches.
• Provides actionable recommendations that respect operational copnstraints.
• Achieves industry-leading performance (26.7% electrical energy reduction) through principled 
causal reasoning.
The extension of Causal Bayesian Optimization from academic settings to heavy industrial application 
opens new possibilities for sustainable manufacturing across energy-intensive industries.
6.2 Future Work
The promising results of this research open several avenues for future work:
1. Technology enhancement opportunities: Future work can focus on enhancing the optimizer's 
computational efficiency to enable real-time optimization. Additionally, reinforcement learning 
techniques can improve the system's adaptability to changing raw material properties and equipment 
conditions.
106
2. Additional application areas: While this study focused on raw meal grinding, the hybrid causal 
optimization approach shows potential for application across other energy-intensive cement 
manufacturing processes: clinker production, cement grinding, and material transport systems present 
opportunities for similar optimization. Beyond cement, the methodology could be extended to other 
process industries with complex, nonlinear operations, such as steel manufacturing, chemical 
processing, and pulp and paper production.
3. Future development work motivated by industry demand would explore integration pathways with 
existing control systems and industry-standard platforms. Developing standardized interfaces for 
common distributed control systems (DCS) would accelerate adoption. Cloud-based deployment 
options would make the technology accessible to smaller operations without requiring significant onpremises computing infrastructure.
4. Research directions: Important research questions remain to be explored. First, investigating methods 
to incorporate domain knowledge into the causal discovery process could accelerate model 
development and improve interpretability. Second, developing techniques for transfer learning between 
different grinding units and plants could reduce implementation time. Finally, causal reinforcement 
learning [155] represents the next step for this research, combining causal inference's ability to reason 
about counterfactuals with reinforcement learning’s sequential decision optimization. This approach 
may address several key challenges in cement grinding optimization. It can enable scenario analysis 
without physical experimentation, improve knowledge transfer between different grinding units, 
determine optimal timing for parameter adjustments, and create effective human-AI collaborative 
systems. Future work could yield significant academic contributions and enhanced practical benefits in 
energy efficiency and quality control by developing causal structural models of the grinding process 
and reformulating optimization as a causally aware decision process.

because making cement creates a lot of pollution. By examining cement production through multiple 
lenses—from lifecycle assessment to electrical energy consumption optimization and causal modeling—
this research has developed a comprehensive framework for decarbonization that balances environmental 
impact, economic viability, and product quality
