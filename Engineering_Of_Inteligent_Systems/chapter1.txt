Chapter 1 - Introduction
1.1 Global Cement Production and Environmental Impact
Cement-based materials are essential for urban development, with a rich history dating back to the 
Egyptian pyramids (3000 BC) and Roman architecture (300 BC-476 AD). Joseph Aspdin's invention of 
Portland cement in 1824 revolutionized construction and enabled landmark structures from the Alvord Lake 
Bridge (1889) to the Hoover Dam (1936) and modern skyscrapers. However, this essential material comes 
with significant environmental consequences.
Growing awareness of the importance of mitigating climate change drives research efforts toward 
developing economically viable technologies for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The high energy 
consumption and carbon-intensive nature of cement manufacturing make it worthwhile to examine the 
environmental and economic characteristics of process improvements in cement production. Climate 
change and further warming due to greenhouse gases in the atmosphere can significantly impact life. Its 
effects include frequent and severe storms, wildfires, floods, heavy precipitation in some regions and severe 
drought in others, rising sea levels, and impacts on health, food, and water supply.
Cement production has more than doubled since 2000, with urbanization and infrastructure 
development continuing to drive demand upward. Global cement production reached approximately 4.1 
billion tons in 2022, with China accounting for more than half of the worldwide output [1-2]. Cement 
production is estimated to be responsible for approximately 8% of the global carbon dioxide (CO₂) 
emissions caused by humans [3]. From the statistics in Figure 1 and Figure 2, these emissions have shown 
a troubling trend, increasing faster than the cement production rate, indicating a worsening carbon intensity 
in some regions.

1.2 Carbon Footprint of Cement Manufacturing
Cement production has three stages: raw material extraction and preparation, clinker production, and 
cement grinding. First, limestone (CaCO₃) is ground with other minor constituents and heated at 900°C via 
cyclones. The mixture is passed through the rotary kiln to produce a mixture of calcium silicates (cement 
clinker) from reactions at 1450–1500°C. The clinker is cooled, ground to a fine powder, and mixed with 
gypsum to produce cement [6]. Cement manufacturing is inherently carbon-intensive due to chemical and 
energy-related emissions. Carbon dioxide is a by-product of the chemical conversion process that produces 
3
clinker from limestone and clay. This reaction represented as CaCO₃ + Heat → CaO + CO₂, accounts for 
approximately 60% of emissions in cement production. The remaining emissions come from burning fossil 
fuels to heat the kiln to the extreme temperatures (1450-1500°C) required for clinker formation and from 
generating the electricity that powers various manufacturing processes.
Reports from major Western cement manufacturers such as LafargeHolcim and Heidelberg Cement 
indicate that more than 550 kg of CO₂ is emitted per ton of cement produced. However, due to the high 
temperatures required for its production and the direct emissions from the calcination of limestone, 
decarbonizing cement production is challenging and has been the subject of many research efforts [6-8].
1.3 Current State of Energy Consumption in Cement Production
The cement industry uses 12-15% of the global industrial sector's annual energy consumption, 
highlighting its significant energy footprint [9]. This considerable energy use contributes to approximately 
8% of global CO₂ emissions. Because of the cement industry's environmental impact, specific mitigation 
strategies, such as using alternative fuel and clinker substitution, are required. There are opportunities to 
mitigate CO₂ emissions from process modification and energy efficiency because both process- and fuelrelated emissions account for approximately 40% of total direct emissions. Some CO₂ mitigation methods 
suggested in the literature include carbon sequestration or carbon capture, utilization and storage (CCUS), 
use of alternative fuels in the kiln, energy recovery, waste heat recovery, and increasing the proportion of 
semi-dry and dry processes [10].
Energy consumption in cement manufacturing falls into two major categories: thermal and electrical 
energy. Thermal energy, primarily used in pyro-processing for clinker production, accounts for 
approximately 70-80% of total energy consumption. The International Energy Agency reported that, from 
2010 to 2020, the thermal energy intensity of clinker decreased by 0.2% annually. However, it has since 
plateaued at around 3.6 GJ/t. This decline brought about a rise in the sector's electricity intensity, estimated
at 100 kWh/t cement since 2022 [11].

Electrical energy drives crushing, grinding, conveying, and machine operation throughout the 
manufacturing process of cement. A typical modern cement plant is estimated to consume up to 110 kWh 
of electricity for grinding a ton of cement [12]. About 95 million metric tons of cement was produced in the 
United States in 2022, using up more than 8.9 billion kWh of electricity with resultant emissions of an 
estimated 4.47 million tons of CO₂ by the power plants which typically use fossil fuel or natural gas to 
generate the electric power used for manufacturing [13].
1.4 Research Gap in Electrical Energy Consumption Optimization
The strategies for carbon-reduction process improvements in energy use within cement manufacturing 
have been largely focused on thermal energy despite the significant carbon emission contribution from 
electrical energy consumption (EEC) during production [13]. Research findings indicate that adopting some 
of the advancements in thermal energy efficiency in cement production increased EEC within the sector. 
The cost of cement production rises directly with the price of electricity. EEC in raw meal grinding is a 
critical aspect of cement production, where grinding operations can account for up to 27% of total plant 
electricity demand [14]. The energy required for grinding operations represents one of the largest 
operational costs in this industry, directly impacting production efficiency and sustainability metrics. This 
emphasizes the value obtainable from optimizing EEC in the raw meal grinding process of cement 
manufacturing.
Despite its obvious importance, research on implementing electrical energy-saving measures at the 
plant level has been surprisingly slow. The literature search indicates that studies on power consumption 
optimization in cement manufacturing are limited in number and scope [13]. This presents a significant 
research gap that this dissertation aims to address.
1.4.1 Limitations of Conventional Optimization Approaches
Implementing optimization within the complex system of raw meal grinding is quite challenging. The 
challenges primarily revolve around the complexity of the grinding process and the requirements for 
5
accuracy in modeling. The nonlinear nature of grinding, coupled with variable working conditions, 
complicates the establishment of effective mathematical models for optimization. Advanced modeling 
techniques are being developed to optimize grinding parameters and improve throughput [15]. However, 
many efforts are not focused on improving the energy efficiency of the raw meal grinding process.
Traditional optimization approaches using a simple machine learning model of a cement plant have not 
resulted in sustainability practices at the cement plant because they have struggled to fully address the 
inherent complexity and nonlinearity of the raw meal grinding process. The outcomes of typical traditional 
optimization have been difficult to translate to actual interventions at the cement plant.
1.4.2 Need for a Different Approach
Unlike simple ML models operating in optimization loops that treat process variables as independent 
inputs without understanding causal relationships, cement manufacturing requires understanding why 
parameter changes affect electrical energy consumption. Listed under are limitations with traditional 
optimization approaches that make them sub-optimal for optimizing electrical energy consumption in the 
raw meal grinding system of cement manufacturing:
• Not distinguishing between correlation and causation in complex industrial systems.
• Failing to account for confounding variables and material variations.
• Difficulty in ascertaining that their interventions will not violate physical constraints or quality 
requirements.
• Difficulty in handling the significant disturbances (such as noise, environmental factors, 
material variations, and human interactions) inherent in real-world manufacturing.
1.5 Systems Engineering Approach to Sustainable Manufacturing
Addressing the complex challenges of sustainable cement manufacturing requires a comprehensive 
systems engineering approach. Systems engineering principles provide a framework for bringing systems 
into being, encompassing system synthesis, analysis and evaluation, system life-cycle engineering, and 
6
implementation. This approach is particularly valuable for tackling the multifaceted problem of optimizing 
electrical energy consumption in cement production while maintaining product quality and economic 
viability.
The cement production system can be decomposed into ten interconnected subsystems. Figure 3 shows 
this decomposition and estimates the specific electrical energy consumption (SEEC) within each subsystem.
Figure 3: Cement production as a system of systems
A system of systems (SoS) engineering approach enables the integration of these subsystems into a 
cohesive whole. SoS engineering is defined by distinguishing characteristics and views a system-of-systems 
as a network whose engineering can benefit from network management best practices [16]. This perspective 
is essential for understanding the interconnected nature of cement manufacturing processes and identifying 
opportunities for optimization across subsystem boundaries.
With the advent of Industry 4.0 and the industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), there are new opportunities 
to apply advanced technologies to cement manufacturing. Digitalization and data-driven process 
optimization of cement manufacturing will help the industry better manage energy consumption and reduce 
7
emissions and raw material inefficiencies [17]. There has been improvement in sensors, data management, 
related Internet of Things (IoT) toolkits, and increased maturity levels of artificial intelligence. These and 
the templatization of life cycle and techno-economic assessments all contribute to a deployment framework 
for continuously assessing the economic and environmental impact of process improvements in cement 
manufacturing [18].
1.6 Goals, Research Questions, and Contributions
The main objective of this research is to determine if operational data from a cement manufacturing 
system can be used to engineer systems to reduce carbon emissions in the cement manufacturing process 
while maintaining product quality and economic viability. The scope of the study includes how to leverage 
advanced analytics, industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), and systems engineering principles to develop 
methods for sustainable cement manufacturing process improvements.
To accomplish the goal, research questions were identified as follows:
• How can causal relationships between operational variables be systematically identified and leveraged 
in cement raw meal grinding optimization, where traditional ML approaches fail due to confounding 
variables and complex interdependencies?
• What framework can effectively handle the significant real-world disturbances (material variations, 
environmental factors, equipment degradation) that render conventional optimization approaches 
inadequate in industrial cement manufacturing?
• How can Causal Bayesian Optimization be adapted to complex, real-world industrial systems with 
operational constraints, quality requirements, and safety considerations?
The hypothesis is that proper analysis of the cement plant operational data by leveraging advanced 
analytics and systems thinking can result in process improvement recommendations for the cement industry. 
More specifically, this research represents a significant advancement in industrial optimization by:
8
• Introducing the first comprehensive causal framework for industrial energy optimization that goes 
beyond correlation-based approaches to understand true cause-and-effect relationships in 
manufacturing systems.
• Creating a generalizable systems engineering framework that integrates environmental impact 
assessment and economic viability analysis of process improvements to help cement manufacturers 
make informed decisions that balance sustainability and profitability.
• Address a critical gap in sustainable cement manufacturing by focusing on optimizing electrical energy 
consumption, which has received less attention than thermal energy improvements despite its 
significant environmental impact.
• Pioneering the application of causal inference and Bayesian optimization techniques in heavy industrial 
settings to reduce electrical energy consumption in the raw meal grinding subsystem of cement 
manufacturing, extending CBO to complex manufacturing environments with multiple constraints and 
disturbances.
