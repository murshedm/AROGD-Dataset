Chapter 2 – Literature Review and Existing Methods
A peer-reviewed publication [18] previously addressed the literature review and discussion of existing 
methods for sustainability in cement manufacturing. This chapter includes an updated version of part of 
that publication. It also consists of a literature review of existing methods of causal inference optimization, 
which has been addressed in another paper submitted for publication by the author.
2.1 Literature Review: Cement Manufacturing and Sustainability
According to a World Economic Forum publication in 2024, cement manufacturing remains one of the 
most significant industrial contributors to global greenhouse gas emissions [19]. Demand for cement is 
expected to increase as the need for infrastructure development continues to expand in emerging markets. 
The tension between increasing construction needs and decarbonization goals creates a significant 
sustainability dilemma. As a result, the decarbonization of the cement manufacturing process has received 
research attention, and there is a lot of literature on CO2 mitigation methods. 
2.1.1 Environmental Impact Factors in Cement Production
The environmental impacts of cement manufacturing span across multiple dimensions and create a 
complex sustainability challenge that requires a systems approach to address effectively. As already 
identified, carbon emissions remain a challenge. Despite innovations in production methods and the 
development of alternative materials, the fundamental chemistry of cement production makes complete 
elimination of emissions challenging without carbon capture.
Another factor is the energy consumed in the manufacturing of cement. Substantial thermal energy is 
required for clinker production, and electrical energy is needed for grinding operations, motors, and material 
movement and separation equipment. Fossil fuels are the sector's main source of thermal energy and make 
up about 90% of the energy mix. At the same time, bioenergy, renewable, and non-renewable waste make 
up the balance [11]. While electrical energy consumption is smaller in absolute terms than thermal 
11
energy consumption, it is still substantial, requiring 90-110kWh per ton of cement. In many regions where 
cement is manufactured, electricity is also generated from fossil fuel sources, further contributing to the 
carbon footprint of cement production.
Other environmental impact factors of cement manufacturing include raw material consumption, water 
and pollution, air and particulate emissions, waste generation and management, land use, and ecosystem 
impacts [20]. Cement production places a lot of demand on natural resources, particularly limestone, the 
primary raw material. Water is used in cement manufacturing for cooling equipment, controlling dust, and 
processing materials. Apart from greenhouse gases, cement manufacturing also generates other air 
pollutants (dust, nitrogen oxides, sulfur oxide, carbon monoxide, etc.) that affect local air quality and human 
health. Cement production creates waste such as kiln dust, bypass dust, and rejected materials, some of 
which cannot be recycled and require waste disposal. Cement plants and associated limestone quarries take 
up large land areas, potentially leading to habitat loss, deforestation, and landscape alterations.
2.1.2 Current Sustainability Approaches
The decarbonization pathways in the cement industry include replacing clinker with supplementary 
cementitious materials, alternative chemistries and processes to replace limestone from the clinker 
production process, fuel switching and electrification, and carbon capture.
Cement companies can leverage carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies to capture CO2 from 
significant point sources in their manufacturing process or the atmosphere, transport it, and store it 
permanently underground. The paper in [21] examined limitations in deploying CCS technologies despite 
their availability and maturity. The authors advocate for expanding government policies to incentivize the 
adoption of CCS and mandate its deployment.
Using alternative fuels properly can reduce the cement industry's environmental impacts. Related research 
has advanced, indicating that introducing solid waste materials as alternative fuels in cement manufacturing 
will lower energy consumption and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. By coupling the cement and waste 
management industries, solid waste materials such as municipal solid waste, sewage sludge, biomass, end-
12
of-life tires, and meat and bone animal meal can be considered alternative fuels to replace or reduce the 
consumption of non-renewable fossil fuels in cement manufacturing [22].
More cement factories are now leveraging Waste Heat Recovery (WHR) systems to achieve energy 
performance as required by standards and legislation. The waste heat from the kiln is used as a power 
generation source, thus reducing thermal energy losses and improving the energy efficiency of the cement 
manufacturing process. In [23], the authors evaluated the performance of a WHR system, comparing it to 
the estimated performance from feasibility studies and proved positive financial indicators by comparing 
actual to updated capital expenditures. In addition, energy efficiency can be improved in cement production 
by leveraging process control and management systems, high-efficiency motors and drives, and efficient 
grinding technologies.
The process routes for cement manufacture are dry, semi-dry, semi-wet, and wet. The wet processes 
consume more energy than the dry processes. While the choice of process is primarily determined by the 
availability of raw materials, with expansion and significant improvements in the cement plant, semi-dry 
processes can be changed to dry processes to reduce GHG emissions [10].
Table 1 summarizes decarbonization methods in literature, the materials and equipment used, and cost 
examples where available.
2.1.3 Limitations to Sustainability Approaches in Cement Manufacturing
The referenced publications [13,18] by the author cover key limitations of current sustainability 
approaches in cement manufacturing, and they are highlighted below:
2.1.3.1 Technical and Process Limitations
1. Process emissions inherent to traditional chemistry: Approximately 60% of cement production 
emissions come from the calcination process itself, making them difficult to eliminate without 
fundamental changes to cement chemistry or using carbon capture technologies.

2. Energy efficiency plateaus: According to an International Energy Agency Report, the intensity of 
thermal energy use has plateaued at around 3.6 GJ/t after initial improvements, suggesting 
conventional efficiency measures are reaching their limits [11].
3. Contradictory optimization effects: Some thermal energy efficiency advancements have increased 
electrical energy consumption, creating a trade-off rather than a net sustainability gain.
2.1.3.2 Implementation and System Integration Challenges
1. Capital-intensive infrastructure requirements: Many sustainability approaches require significant 
capital investments with extended payback periods, thus creating financial barriers to adoption, 
especially for aging cement plants.
2. Siloed approaches: The overall effectiveness of current sustainability methods is often limited 
because they focus on isolated aspects of production rather than viewing cement manufacturing as 
an integrated system.
3. Limited data utilization: Despite the potential of IoT and digitalization, there's a gap in effectively 
utilizing operational data for optimization. Many cement plants fail to collect and store operational 
data and do not invest in technical resources, resulting in a lack of leverage of advanced analytic 
capabilities.
4. Inconsistent measurement frameworks. Standardizing environmental impact measurements across 
different production scenarios, technologies, and geographical regions presents challenges.
These limitations collectively point to the need for more integrated, system-based approaches that combine 
technological innovations with advanced analytics and consider environmental and economic factors within 
a unified framework.
2.1.4 Systems Perspective on Cement Manufacturing Sustainability
In addition to process improvements, a comprehensive systems approach to cement manufacturing 
sustainability considers the entire production value chain. Its scope covers from raw material extraction to 
end-of-life considerations. This perspective considers the interconnections between various subsystems and 
16
stakeholders in the cement ecosystem. Within this view, concepts like circular economy, industry 4.0, and 
digital technologies are powerful tools for implementing this systems approach to sustainability [31]. These 
technologies can help manage the complex trade-offs between environmental impact, product quality, and 
economic viability central to sustainable cement manufacturing.
2.2 Literature Review: Optimization Methods in Cement Production
Optimizing energy use in cement production has become an imperative rather than an option for 
manufacturers. The cement manufacturing industry faces dual pressures of economic competition and 
environmental sustainability. Cement manufacturing optimization spans multiple objectives: reducing 
energy consumption, minimizing emissions, maintaining product quality, maximizing production 
efficiency, and ensuring economic viability.
2.2.1 Evolution of Optimization Approaches
Literature on cement production optimization has evolved over the past two decades to reflect 
technological advancements, analytical methods, and sustainability priorities. More recent literature has 
gone beyond just focusing on mechanical and thermal efficiency improvements through equipment 
upgrades and process modifications to following electrical energy optimization within several key themes: 
"automation and process control, power generation from waste heat recovery systems, digitalization and 
application of artificial intelligence" [13]. The advent of Industry 4.0 technologies enables more 
sophisticated optimization methods to handle the complex, nonlinear relationships and multiple objective 
characteristics of optimization in cement manufacturing.
2.2.2 Scope and Organization of Literature Review
Chapter 4 of this dissertation is an update on the author's publication of a systematic literature review 
that synthesizes and analyzes existing scholarly works and industry reports on general methods and 
approaches for electrical energy consumption in cement production. Optimization methods are evaluated 
for their theoretical soundness and practical applicability in cement production plants. Consideration is 
given to implementation challenges, data requirements, and demonstrated benefits.
17
The literature review in this chapter is restricted to methods for optimizing EEC through the lens of 
‘causality’ – the idea that one event or action can lead to another event or outcome. This lens identifies more 
accurate interventions and enables a better process understanding by examining direct causal relationships, 
indirect causal paths, and confounding variables. It covers causal inference and Bayesian optimization 
methods that explicitly model causal relationships between process variables, enabling more effective 
interventions. The interventions can be applied directly to operation parameters at the cement plant to 
realize a measurable reduction in electrical energy consumption. 
2.2.3 Optimization Methods
Leveraging causal inference and Bayesian statistical methods would be effective in determining the 
measures of operational parameters that would yield optimal EEC, especially in the raw meal grinding 
subsystem of the cement production system. The methods' applications suggest their effectiveness for 
decision-making in this scenario, where understanding cause and effect is crucial, and interventions can be 
applied to attain reduced levels of EEC at the cement plant.
2.2.3.1 Iterative Causal Inference
Iterative Causal Inference (ICI) leverages causal relationships among variables to optimize complex 
systems. It's a methodology that enhances understanding underlying dynamics and improves decision 
making. ICI employs causality-based learning to identify model structures and recover unobserved 
variables, making it more resistant to random noise than purely data-driven methods [32]. The algorithm 
creates mathematical models to estimate variables that can't be directly observed and treats these estimates 
as if they were actual measurements. It focuses on local relationships between variables while incorporating 
known constraints and leverages specialized techniques to prevent mathematical instabilities. The approach 
leverages iterations that refine causal graphs based on conditional independence tests. Rohekar, Raanan Y., 
et al. [33] present a comprehensive paper on the iterative causal discovery algorithm for recovering causal 
graphs when there are latent confounders and selection bias. This approach assumes a directed acyclic graph 
(DAG) for the underlying causal structure and focuses on learning it from observational data. 
18
Figure 4: Network visualization of causal relationships in the raw meal grinding process
Figure 4 plots the causal relationships between EEC (Y) and the multiple variables of the raw meal grinding 
system after dimension reduction to 3 variables (XV1, XV2, XV3) with the partial least square regression 
algorithm. Process variables are nodes, and the causal relationship is depicted as arrows in the diagram. The 
colors of the arrows indicate relationship strengths.
Structural vector autoregressive (SVAR) processes, which are often employed in causal inference when 
modeling time series data, can be rephrased as a linear Structural Causal Model (SCM) of stochastic 
processes on a simple causal graph [34]. Peters et al. [35] provide a generalized definition of structural 
causal models in their study of causal models for dynamical systems. 
Suppose a structural causal model (SCM) of the raw meal grinding system is defined as
M = (X, U, f, P(U)) (1)
where:
• X = {X1, X2, …, XN} are observed variables in the raw mill grinding data (e.g., limestone flow rate (T), 
raw mill motor (kW))
19
• U = {U1, U2, …, UN} are exogenous variables (unobserved)
• ƒ = {ƒ1, ƒ2, …, ƒN} are causal mechanisms
• P(U) is a probability distribution over U
Each variable is determined by Xi = ƒi(Pa(Xi), Ui), where Pa(Xi) are parents of Xi in the causal graph [36].
Iterative causal inference combines causal discovery with optimization in a step-by-step iterative process 
as follows:
1. Causal Discovery. At iteration t in the causal discovery step, estimated causal effects are given 
by:
𝜏𝑖
(𝑡) = 𝐸[𝑌|𝑑𝑜(𝑋𝑖 = 𝑥𝑖 + 𝛿)] − 𝐸[𝑌|𝑑𝑜(𝑋𝑖 = 𝑥𝑖
)] (2)
Using Python programming language, this is estimated with a method like Double Machine 
Learning [37, 38]:
𝜏𝑖
(𝑡) =
𝐸[(𝑌−𝐸[𝑌|𝑋\𝑖
]).(𝑋𝑖−𝐸[𝑋𝑖
|𝑋\𝑖
])]
𝐸[(𝑋𝑖−𝐸[𝑋𝑖
|𝑋\𝑖
])
2]
(3)
2. Optimization. Variables are updated based on causal effects:
𝑋𝑖
(𝑡+1) = 𝑋𝑖
(𝑡) − 𝜂. 𝜏𝑖
(𝑡) where 𝜂 is the learning rate
3. Constraint Application: 𝑋𝑖
(𝑡+1) = 𝑐𝑙𝑖𝑝(𝑋𝑖
(𝑡+1)
,𝑋𝑖,𝑚𝑖𝑛,𝑋𝑖,𝑚𝑎𝑥)
The causal effect 𝜏𝑖
indicates how changing variable 𝑋𝑖 affects the target variable Y (EEC). If 𝜏𝑖 > 0, 
increasing 𝑋𝑖
increases Y. To make optimal adjustments to EEC, the update rule decreases variables with 
positive causal effects and increases variables with negative effects, moving toward lower EEC. The 
constraint application step captures the manufacturing requirements and limitations of the raw meal 
grinding system. In practice, constraint values can be obtained from subject matter experts, raw meal 
grinding equipment manuals, manufacturing process records, and the upper and lower-level bounds of the 
variables in historical data. As variables change, their causal effects may change due to nonlinear 
relationships. Re-estimating causal effects at each step addresses this. 
20
Iterative causal inference offers robust frameworks for understanding causal relationships and 
optimizing a target variable by manipulating variables with direct causal relationships. Causal inference 
handles confounding and ensures adjustments are based on true causal relationships rather than spurious 
correlations. It also incorporates domain constraints. Its implementation provides statistical significance of 
causal effects and a clear interpretation of variable interactions. This gives it the key advantage over 
traditional optimization. However, it is important to recognize the limitations of assumptions of 
independence and the possibility of model misspecification, which can lead to biased estimates. This 
approach requires substantial historical data and is less adaptive to rapid system changes.
2.2.3.2 Causal Bayesian Optimization Framework
Causal Bayesian Optimization (CBO) is an advancement in the field of optimization that integrates 
causal inference with Bayesian Optimization (BO) frameworks. CBO is particularly useful in scenarios 
where understanding the causal relationships between variables can lead to more effective optimization 
strategies. It addresses a fundamental limitation in traditional Bayesian optimization: the inability to 
distinguish between correlation and causation in complex systems. CBO is apt for efficient and robust 
optimization in a domain such as raw meal grinding, where interventions have downstream effects and 
underlying causal mechanisms govern the relationship between variables. While CBO offers significant 
advantages, it requires efficient intervention strategies and has scalability challenges in high-dimensional 
settings. These challenges are being addressed through innovative algorithms and frameworks.
Researchers have recently adopted different CBO applications to enable optimization strategies. The 
architecture of the algorithms varies depending on the specific challenges they address. DAG recovery via 
Bayesian Optimization (DrBO) is a framework that utilizes Bayesian optimization to identify high-scoring 
DAGs from observational data [39] efficiently. The graph-agnostic CBO (GaCBO) algorithm outperforms 
traditional methods by integrating causal discovery as a subtask within CBO, addressing cumulative regret 
objectives in scenarios with unknown or partially known graphs [40]. High-dimensional CBO (HCBO) 
enhances optimization in complex scenarios by employing causal intrinsic dimensionality and a scale-
21
normalized scoring function [41]. Constrained CBO (cCBO) optimizes target variables under constraints 
by reducing the search space using known causal graph structures and observational data. It models target 
and constraint quantities with Gaussian processes, selects interventions via a constrained expected 
improvement acquisition function, and balances fast convergence with feasible interventions [42].
The general algorithm for CBO is as follows:
1. Initialize with prior causal knowledge or learn the causal structure from observational data.
2. For 𝑡 = 1, 2, … , 𝑇:
a) Update the surrogate model (statistical model, often a Gaussian Process) based on observed data
b) Estimate causal effects for candidate interventions
c) Select the next intervention point by optimizing the acquisition function
d) Apply intervention and observe the outcome
e) Update dataset
In CBO, the optimization objective incorporates the causal effect of interventions:
𝑥
∗ = arg 𝑚𝑖𝑛𝑥∈𝑋 𝐸[𝑌|𝑑𝑜(𝑋 = 𝑥)] where 𝑑𝑜(𝑋 = 𝑥) represents setting variables 𝑋 to values 𝑥 through 
intervention rather than mere observation. The surrogate model in CBO is built to approximate the 
interventional distribution 𝑃(𝑌|𝑑𝑜(𝑋 = 𝑥)) rather than the observational distribution 𝑃(𝑌|𝑋 = 𝑥).
CBO can use a linear regression approach for causal effect estimation:
𝜏𝑗 = 𝐸[𝑌|𝑑𝑜(𝑋𝑗 = 𝑥𝑗)] − 𝐸[𝑌|𝑑𝑜(𝑋𝑗 = 𝑥𝑗
′
)] (4)
Where 𝜏𝑗
is the causal effect of variable 𝑋𝑗 on outcome 𝑌
𝑑𝑜(𝑋𝑗 = 𝑥𝑗) represents the intervention of setting variable 𝑋𝑗
to 𝑥𝑗
𝐸[ ] denotes the expected value
Implementation is via backdoor adjustment:
𝜏𝑗 = ∫ 𝐸[𝑌|𝑋𝑗 = 𝑥𝑗
, 𝑍 = 𝑧] . 𝑃(𝑍 = 𝑧)𝑑𝑧 − ∫ 𝐸[𝑌|𝑋𝑗 = 𝑥𝑗
′
, 𝑍 = 𝑧] . 𝑃(𝑍 = 𝑧)𝑑𝑧 (5)
22
𝑃(𝑍 = 𝑧) is the probability distribution of the confounding variables, and 𝑍 represents the set of 
confounding variables. The integrals average over all possible values of the confounding variables. 
The Gaussian process kernel [43] in CBO is a standard kernel with uniform length scales. The kernel 
function that measures similarity between points 𝑥 and 𝑥
′
is defined as:
𝑘(𝑥, 𝑥
′
) = 𝜎𝑓
2
exp (−
1
2
∑
(𝑥𝑗− 𝑥𝑗
′
)
2
𝑙
𝑗
2 )
𝑑
𝑗=1
 (6)
Where:
𝜎𝑓
2
is the signal variance (amplitude parameter)
𝑑 is the number of dimensions (variables)
𝑥𝑗 𝑎𝑛𝑑 𝑥𝑗
′
are the 𝑗
th components of vectors 𝑥 and 𝑥
′
𝑙𝑗 are the length scale parameters controlling how quickly correlation decreases with the gap between 
different input points
CBO selects interventions via a standard expected improvement acquisition function, uses simple 
boundary constraints, and uses a standard Bayesian optimization loop in its optimization process.
Standard Expected Improvement (EI) at point 𝑥 is given as:
𝐸𝐼(𝑥) = 𝐸[max(𝑓(𝑥) − 𝑓(𝑥
+), 0)] and can be computed as 
𝐸𝐼(𝑥) = (𝑓(𝑥
+) − 𝜇(𝑥))Φ(𝑍) + 𝜎(𝑥)𝜙(𝑍) (7)
Where 𝑓(𝑥) is the true objective function and 𝑓(𝑥
+) is the current best observed value. μ(x) is the mean 
prediction of the Gaussian process at 𝑥, and 𝜎(𝑥) is the standard deviation of the Gaussian process 
prediction at 𝑥. ϕ(Z) represents the standard normal probability density function evaluated at Z.
Key components of CBO are listed below:
• Learning or identifying a causal structure. Some of the methods used include constraint-based 
algorithms [44,45], score-based methods [46], intervention-based approaches [47], and expert 
knowledge integration.
23
• Estimating causal effects. When all confounders are observed, an adjustment formula can be used, or 
methods like double machine learning and causal forests can be used [48].
• Modification of acquisition functions to account for causal information: causal expected improvement 
[42], causal upper confidence bound [49], and knowledge gradient with causal information [50].
CBO leverages the relationships between process variables to optimize EEC through interventions. This 
approach models complex dependencies and captures the dynamics of processes, facilitating more informed 
decision-making in the optimization task.
Limitations and Open Challenges - despite its advantages, CBO faces several challenges:
• Causal Discovery Uncertainty: Errors in causal structure learning can propagate to optimization
• Computational Complexity: Integrating causal inference with BO increases computational demands
• Limited Interventional Data: Many domains lack sufficient interventional data
• High-dimensional Spaces: Scaling CBO to high-dimensional spaces remains challenging
• Unobserved Confounding: Handling latent confounders in the optimization process. 
There’s an opportunity to tune an application of CBO to address some of these challenges.
